  <h2 id='ch1' class='c005'>CHAPTER ONE<br /> <br />The Man of Mystery</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >The high pitched drone of a wasp engine
sounded over the municipal field at
Atkinson and Tim Murphy, famous flying
reporter of the Atkinson <i>News</i>, poked a
grease-smudged face out from behind the cowling of
a trim biplane and squinted skyward. Against
the brilliant sky of the late summer afternoon
was the outline of one of the new high speed
transports of the Red Arrow Transcontinental
Air Express Company.</p>

<p class='c007' >The <i>Day Express</i>, Chicago to the west
coast, was swinging around, preparatory to
landing on the smooth, crushed-rock runway.
Tim watched with appreciative eyes. The new
transports, capable of winging their way from
coast to coast at better than three miles a
minute, always fascinated him. He envied the trim,
clear-eyed young chaps who sat at the controls
while they in turn would have been willing to
exchange their daily routine for the
adventurous news assignments which often came Tim’s
way.</p>

<p class='c007' >The twin motors, mounted in nacelles
projecting from the sturdy wing, idled as the ship
drifted downward to touch lightly on the
runway and roll smoothly toward the main
hangar.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Star gazing again?” asked a quiet voice at
Tim’s elbow.</p>

<p class='c007' >The flying reporter turned quickly. Carl
Hunter, manager of the airport, was beside
him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I always get a thrill watching those high
speeds come in. There’s something in it that
gets into my blood and makes it tingle.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’re the finest transport planes in the
world,” nodded Hunter.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’d like to fly one of them,” mused
Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >Hunter looked at Tim shrewdly. The
flying reporter was slender but his muscles were
like tensed steel. His blue eyes were clear and
unwavering. There was a pleasant twist to his
lips but from experience the field manager
knew that they could snap into an
uncompromising line of determination.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll get you a job on the Transcontinental
any day you want one,” he said. “Come over
to my office and fill out the application blank.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That would mean leaving the <i>News</i>,” said
Tim. Then, as Hunter grinned broadly, he
added, “I guess the smell of printer’s ink is
stronger than the call of the skyways. I’m a
reporter first and a flyer second.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I wouldn’t rank either of your abilities
ahead of the other. You’re first class at both.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thanks, Carl. That reminds me. Have one
of the boys finish up this job. Give all of the
plugs a good cleaning. I’d almost forgotten I’ve
got another column to write for my
department in tomorrow’s paper.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll make out a work ticket right away.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim slipped out of his jumper and followed
the field manager toward the main hangar. The
usual crowd of curious people was lined up
inside the ropes to watch the passengers as they
disembarked. Tim, always on the lookout,
scanned them as they came down the steps
from the plane.</p>

<p class='c007' >Two attractive girls were first. They looked
as though they might be movie actresses. He’d
check the passenger list with the stewardess to
make sure. An actress was always worth a
paragraph or two.</p>

<p class='c007' >The last man to leave the ship drew Tim’s
attention. There was something vaguely
familiar in the carriage of the head and the set of
the jaw.</p>

<p class='c007' >The stewardess came by and Tim hailed her.
“Who’s the tall, well-built fellow in the
gray suit?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007' >The girl scanned the passenger list.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sorry, I can’t tell you. He isn’t listed.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What do you mean by that? Is he
traveling on a pass?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hardly. I collected his fare in Chicago and
he’s getting off here.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then you must know his name.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He didn’t give me his name and
instructions from the general manager were to do as
he directed so I’ve listed him on my seat chart
as ‘Mr. Seven.’ That’s the chair he occupied
on the trip out.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim thanked the stewardess and hurried
into Carl Hunter’s office.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Who’s the mysterious man who came in
on the <i>Day Express</i>?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s just as mysterious to me as he is to
you,” replied the field chief. “Why don’t you
ask him what it’s all about? I’ve had a radio
from the general manager to extend him every
courtesy and not to ask questions, but I guess
that doesn’t cover you.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Asking questions is one of the things I do
best,” grinned Tim as he left the office.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Mr. Seven” was superintending the
unloading of his luggage from the plane. Three
large traveling bags were pulled out of the
baggage compartment and Tim whistled as he
thought of the excess fees which must have
been paid for the transport of the heavy bags
by air.</p>

<p class='c007' >When “Mr. Seven” had made sure that his
baggage was in proper order, Tim stepped up.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m Tim Murphy of the Atkinson <i>News</i>,”
he said. “Your face seems vaguely familiar but
I can’t place your name. Since you are
stopping here, I’d like very much to have a story.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sorry, Murphy, but there’s nothing I can
tell you. I prefer not to talk to reporters.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim was undaunted. “Do you plan on
staying long in Atkinson?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s another question I decline to
answer.” The muscles around the stranger’s jaw
were tightening and Tim sensed stormy
weather ahead. Normally he would have let
the whole matter drop but there was
something so definitely perplexing in the other
man’s attitude that he persisted in his
questioning.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You must have some special mission here,”
said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I told you before that I wouldn’t talk. You
can fire away with questions all the rest of the
afternoon and you’ll get the same result—zero.
Now if you’ll be good enough to suggest your
best hotel, I’ll be on my way up town.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim named the city’s leading hotel. “I’ll be
glad to take you there in one of the <i>News</i>’
cars,” he added.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thanks, but I’d have to parry too many
of your questions.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s a draw so far,” smiled Tim, “but I’ll
bet I know your name before another 24
hours, ‘Mr. Seven.’”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Why call me ‘Mr. Seven?’”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s what the stewardess did. You were
in chair seven coming out from Chicago.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s as good a name as any other.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Except your real one,” interjected Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Mr. Seven” bundled his bags into a taxi and
whirled away toward the city while Tim stood
on the ramp and gazed after the car.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That fellow’s face is familiar,” he
muttered half aloud, “and I’m going to dig into
our files at the office until I find his picture.
Unless my hunch is way wrong, there must be
a big story connected with him.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim’s hunches were notoriously right and
just how correct this one was, even Tim would
never have dared dream.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch2' class='c005'>CHAPTER TWO<br /> <br />A Secret Service Case</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >When Tim reached the <i>News</i> office
he found a note rolled into his
typewriter asking him to see the managing editor.
He crossed the large news room and knocked
at the glass-panelled door which bore the
printed words, “George Carson, Managing
Editor.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Come in,” boomed a voice from behind
the door and Tim stepped into the office.
“You wanted to see me?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sit down, Tim,” smiled the sandy-haired
editor who guided the destinies of the <i>News</i>.
He motioned toward a chair.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve had some correspondence with Ace
McDowell of the High Flyers, a flying circus
that is rated one of the best in the country. He
wants to bring his show in here this week-end
under the auspices of the <i>News</i>. What do you
think about it?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve never met Ace or any of his fliers,”
replied Tim, “but they have the reputation of
putting on a good air show.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It struck me as rather a good idea,” went
on the managing editor. “We could give the
show a lot of space in the <i>News</i> and it would
help popularize the airport. Some people are
kicking about the taxes they have to pay to
help support the field. Do you think you could
arrange things with Carl Hunter so the show
can come in Saturday afternoon and put
on their stunts Sunday? Of course they’ll
be carrying passengers between stunt
flights.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll call Hunter at once,” promised Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >He left the managing editor’s office and
placed the call from one of the telephones in
the editorial room.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve no objections to the High Flyers,”
the airport manager said, “but they’ll have to
pay the field the usual percentage for taking up
passengers.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll put that in the contract,” promised
Tim. “Keep this under your hat for I wouldn’t
want the <i>Advance</i> to print the story of our
own air show first.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll forget all about it until I read your story
tomorrow,” promised Hunter.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim returned to the managing editor’s office.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hunter has no objections but the High
Flyers must pay the field fifteen per cent of all
the money they take in on passenger rides.
That’s the customary percentage for
barnstormers.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The managing editor had the contract from
the High Flyers on his desk and Tim, at his
suggestion, filled out the blank.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll telegraph McDowell that we will
expect them to land here Saturday,” said Carson.
“They’re over at Charleston this week.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You might ask him to send on any pictures
of the flyers and planes that are available,”
suggested Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >When Tim left the managing editor’s office
he knew he was in for a busy week. There
would be stories every day about the flying
circus and then the problems of parking and
policing the airport, for a huge crowd would
be on hand to see the stunt flying.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Get the Jupiter all tuned up?” asked
someone behind him.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim turned to face Ralph Graves, another
<i>News</i> reporter who had been his flying
companion on many an adventure. Two years
before when news had been breaking fast on the
skyways, Tim had trained Ralph in flying and
the other reporter now held a transport license.
They were bosom companions and their
managing editor counted on them coming in
with any story to which they were assigned.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I didn’t get all of the plugs cleaned,” said
Tim, “so I’m having the boys at the field finish
the job.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s on Carson’s mind?” asked Ralph,
jerking a thumb toward the managing editor’s
door.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s just contracted to sponsor the
appearance here of Ace McDowell and the High
Flyers. They’ll be in Saturday and put on
their stunts Sunday afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Which means plenty of work for us,”
commented Ralph.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It will mean plenty of work but it will
have everyone talking about the <i>News</i> being
alive and wide awake and that’s what we want.
The <i>Advance</i> is slipping every day and some
morning this fall I wouldn’t be surprised if we
wake up and find that our rival paper has folded
up and, like the Arabs, silently stolen away.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That won’t hurt my feelings a bit,” said
Ralph. “The fellows on the <i>Advance</i> have
made it mighty tough for us these last few
months. They lie, cheat and steal to get their
stories and I’ve run into some actual bribery.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“So have I, but it won’t win for them in
the long run. I’m glad we’re working for a
paper and an editor that’s clean from top to
bottom.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Returning to his desk, Tim rummaged
through the drawers until he found an aviation
magazine which contained an illustrated sketch
of Ace McDowell and his flying circus.
McDowell was short and swarthy with eyes that
were a little too close together to suit Tim.
But the <i>News</i> reporter knew that the head of
the flying circus was a real flyer and would
put on a good show. There was no sense in
building up a prejudice just from a picture.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim rolled a sheet of copy paper into his
typewriter and after a moment’s thought on
the wording of his opening sentence, started
hammering out the story announcing the
coming of the flying circus. By the use of plenty
of adjectives he contrived to write a full
column and, after reading over the story and
correcting one or two minor errors, he laid it on
the copy desk.</p>

<p class='c007' >Dan Watkins, veteran head of the desk,
looked up from beneath his green eye-shade.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good story?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007' >“One of the best you’ll ever read when
it comes to writing a lot from a little,” grinned
Tim. “As a matter of fact, Dan, we’re
promoting an air circus next Sunday and I have a
hunch that Mr. Carson will want a full page
headline on one of the inside pages tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The chief copyreader scanned the story with
practiced eye.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I should say your hunch is correct. I’ll
mark it for an inside banner right now.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The chief copyreader was the only one at
the large desk and Tim sat down on the edge of
the horseshoe-shaped work table.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I wish you had been at the airport this
afternoon,” he said. “You’ve an uncanny
memory for faces and names and it would have
come in handy.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“See someone you couldn’t place?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“There’s something vaguely familiar about
him. I’ve seen his picture some place and I’ve
a hunch there’s a mighty good story connected
with his coming to Atkinson.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You can always ask them questions,”
grinned Dan.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I asked plenty of questions and didn’t get
a thing.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Wouldn’t he talk?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He talked but he didn’t say anything. I
tried the stewardess and also Carl Hunter but
both of them had received instructions from
the general manager of the line in Chicago to
extend this man every courtesy and do as he
directed. The stewardess had him down as ‘Mr.
Seven’ because he occupied chair seven coming
out. When I tackled him about that he said
that ‘Mr. Seven’ was a good enough name. I
couldn’t make a dent in him. He’s smooth as
silk and as hard as steel.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t know exactly. I’ll try to keep tab
on him at the Ransom House where he is
staying but with this flying circus coming to
town I won’t have much extra time. I’m going
to dig into the files and see what I can find
there. I’m positive I’ve seen his picture in the
last year.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I‘ll trail along over to the hotel with you
if you’d like. Maybe I could identify him. I’ve
got one of those card index memories.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I thought maybe you’d help me out, Dan.
We’ll have a try at it after supper. I’ll meet you
at the Ransom House.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim and Ralph had dinner together down
town and Tim told of his meeting the
mysterious “Mr. Seven.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sounds like a story to me,” chuckled
Ralph, “and I’ll be way wrong if you don’t
dig it out. Guess I’ll invite myself in on the
party tonight and trail over to the Ransom
House with you.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Glad to have you. Maybe you’ll be able to
identify my mysterious stranger.”</p>

<p class='c007' >They discussed plans for the flying circus
and after leaving the restaurant proceeded to
the city’s leading hotel. Dan Watkins was
waiting for them in the lobby.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll see what name he registered under,”
said Dan. Inquiry at the desk revealed that the
object of Dan’s curiosity had registered as Mr.
G. Seven of Chicago.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s in the dining room,” said Tim when
he rejoined his companions. “We might as well
sit down here. He’ll have to pass almost directly
in front of us, which will give Dan a good
chance to see him.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“If Dan can’t identify him, I’ll be glad to
help you go through the files,” offered Ralph.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thanks. With all of the details necessary
in arranging for the flying circus I’ll be glad to
have a little extra help. Look sharp now. Here
comes our man.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Mr. Seven” was dressed in the same
well-tailored suit he had worn when he stepped out
of the <i>Day Express</i> and into the life of the
flying reporter. He walked slowly from the
dining room toward the elevators in full view of
the sharp eyes of the newspapermen. They
watched the elevator doors close and turned
to pool the results.</p>

<p class='c007' >Dan Watkins shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m afraid I’m of no help. There’s
something definitely familiar about the face but I
can’t place the name. Maybe it will come to me
later.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim swung around to Ralph. “What about
you?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m just another disappointment and in the
same fix as Dan. ‘Mr. Seven’s’ face is familiar
but that’s as far as it goes. His name is among
the missing.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“If ‘Mr. Seven’ will only stay around until
this air circus is over Sunday I’ll find out what’s
behind his mysterious coming to Atkinson,”
said Tim, who felt that “Mr. Seven” had
challenged his ability as a reporter.</p>

<p class='c007' >On leaving the hotel, they parted, the chief
copy reader returning to his bachelor
headquarters and Tim and Ralph going to the <i>News</i>
building where they hauled out files of the
paper and spread the heavily-bound books on
their desks.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’d better check together,” suggested
Tim. “Then there will be no chance of our
missing a single tip.”</p>

<p class='c007' >For an hour they poured over one volume,
scanning each page and watching with especial
care the picture page which was a daily feature.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m too sleepy to go on,” said Tim when
the city hall clock chimed eleven times. “Being
outdoors most of the afternoon working on
the plane gave me a yen for bed even though I
want to keep on digging into the file. I might
go right on over the very picture I’m looking
for.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ralph picked up a telephone and called the
Ransom House, where he ascertained from
the clerk on duty that Mr G. Seven had
indicated he would be a guest there for at least a
week.</p>

<p class='c007' >Relaying that information on to Tim, Ralph
added, “Now you can go to bed tonight and
sleep soundly.”</p>

<p class='c007' >They had just finished putting away the files
when the door of the editorial room swung
open and a stranger walked in. He was middle
aged, with close-cropped, iron-gray hair,
piercing blue eyes and large, capable hands.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m looking for Tim Murphy and Ralph
Graves, flying reporters of the <i>News</i>” he said.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m Murphy,” said Tim, “and my
companion is Ralph Graves.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then I’m fortunate to find you together.
My card may give you some idea of what I
want.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim took the engraved piece of pasteboard
and read the following words: “Henry
Prentiss, United States Bureau of Narcotics.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m glad to know you, Mr. Prentiss,” said
Tim, “but I’m afraid your card hasn’t given
me any clue on what you’re here for.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I understand the High Flyers and Ace
McDowell are going to put on their air circus
here Sunday under the auspices of the <i>News</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s correct, but no announcement has
been made yet.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then you’re likely to have two stories for
your paper next Monday, the actual story of
the flying circus and the story of the arrest of
Ace McDowell as the head of a notorious ring
of dope smugglers.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch3' class='c005'>CHAPTER THREE<br /> <br />The High Flyers</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >The federal narcotic agent sat down on
the edge of Tim’s desk and smiled at the
amazed expressions on the faces of the flying
reporters.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Do you mean that you are going to arrest
McDowell on a charge of smuggling dope?”
asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m going to do my best to take him in
custody. He’s a slippery customer but I
think we’ve got all the evidence we need this
time.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What a sensation this will make,” whistled
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim was thoughtful. “It’s too bad the <i>News</i>
is sponsoring the appearance of the High
Flyers if their leader is to be arrested on a
federal charge,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m afraid it’s too late to make any changes
now,” said Mr. Prentiss. “As a matter of fact,
it will make a stronger story for, even though
you are now aware of McDowell’s identity,
you will go on and help a federal law
enforcement agency to carry out its duty.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re right on that point,” agreed Tim.
“I’m sure that the <i>News</i> will do all in its power
to help you.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m wondering why you looked us up,”
said Ralph. “You could just as well have waited
until Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“True enough,” nodded the narcotics agent,
“but I know that both you and Murphy, as a
result of your efforts toward the apprehension
of the Sky Hawk and his gang, were made
officers of the state police. I may need a little
official help Sunday and I want men I can trust
in an emergency.”</p>

<p class='c007' >It was a fine compliment to the undaunted
courage of the young newspaper men and
it pleased them both. Prentiss had made warm
friends and allies on whom he could count in
any emergency.</p>

<p class='c007' >“McDowell has been smuggling for a long
time,” went on the federal agent. “We’ve been
after him for two years but he’s a shrewd flyer
and a shrewder smuggler. It wasn’t until I got
one of my own men into his outfit that I
commenced to get results.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ve actually got one of your agents
flying with McDowell?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s rated the next best flyer in the outfit,
Tommy Larkin, by name.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve heard of him,” said Tim, “but I never
dreamed he was a federal agent.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Neither does McDowell or I’m very much
afraid Tommy would be among the missing.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Meaning what?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That it would be comparatively easy for
McDowell to arrange a crack-up of Tommy’s
plane somewhere on a long hop if he ever
became suspicious.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That would be unthinkable,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not for McDowell. You might as well
realize right now that he is ready to go to any
length to save himself from arrest. According
to information from Larkin, McDowell will
receive a new shipment of drugs just before
they take off from Charleston on their flight
here. McDowell is to keep it in his ship until
they reach Nemaha, their next stop after they
finish their exhibition in Atkinson. That means
McDowell will have the stuff on his ship for at
least 24 hours. He flies a four passenger cabin
plane most of the time but for one of the stunts
he goes aloft in a fast two-seater. That’s when
I’ll have a chance to seize the dope in his cabin
ship and take him when he lands.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sounds fine if nothing slips,” nodded Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“There’ll be no slips this time,” promised
the federal agent.</p>

<p class='c007' >They discussed plans for the apprehension
of McDowell at length and before he left the
office, Prentiss promised to see the managing
editor the next day.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m counting on you two to be with me
Sunday,” he said before leaving. “There might
be a leak if I called in the local police or
even some of the state troopers at the barracks
here.”</p>

<p class='c007' >When the narcotics officer had gone, Ralph
wiped his brow and slumped down in the chair
at his own desk.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Talk about news,” he said. “Things never
come singly in a newspaper office. First you
bob in with the mysterious Mr. Seven, then we
put on an air show and now we find the head
of the air circus is wanted by Uncle Sam for
peddling dope. What next?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Learn the identity of ‘Mr. Seven,’”
grinned Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You can worry over that one,” snorted
Ralph. “It’s almost midnight now. I’m going
home and I expect I’ll have all kinds of
nightmares.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“If you suddenly discover the identity of
‘Mr. Seven’ I’ll be glad to answer the phone
even if it is three in the morning,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Just for that, I won’t phone you even if I
do suddenly open some hidden recess in my
brain and recall who he is.” Ralph threw the
words over his shoulder as he left the editorial
room.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim picked up the aviation magazine which
contained the picture of the High Flyers and
looked again at the printed likeness of Ace
McDowell. The eyes were cruel, hard,
merciless. Even on the inanimate page there was
something disturbing about them. Next to
McDowell was the picture of Tommy Larkin.
He was about the age of Tim or Ralph, stocky
and well-built.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim placed the magazine back in one of the
drawers, snapped off the light, and left the
office. As Ralph had observed, things never
came singly, and Tim felt a weight of
apprehension settling on his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007' >The next morning a board of strategy met
in the office of the managing editor. Grouped
around the table facing the heads of the <i>News</i>
were the narcotics officer, Tim and Ralph.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Of course we’ll help in every way
possible,” the managing editor assured Prentiss.
“You can rely upon Tim and Ralph to give you
the utmost assistance and you’ll not find their
courage wanting in the pinches.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s why I came to them,” smiled
Prentiss. “I need two men on whom I can count.”</p>

<p class='c007' >In the rush of plans and details which had to
be worked out for the coming of the High
Flyers, Tim was forced to relegate thoughts of
“Mr. Seven” in the far depths of his mind. He
managed to drop in at the Ransom House once
a day to check on the presence of the
mysterious stranger and each time learned that the
object of his interest was still in Atkinson.</p>

<p class='c007' >The High Flyers arrived late Saturday
afternoon, wheeling down out of a cloudless sky.
There were eight ships, three mechanics and
two stunt men. Six of the planes were trim,
modern crafts but two of them were old
trainers that should have been on the junk heap
long ago. Tim was surprised to see that type
of craft.</p>

<p class='c007' >By agreement, Prentiss had stayed away
from the field for McDowell knew him by
sight.</p>

<p class='c007' >As soon as the ships had rolled up oh the
ramp, Tim stepped out to greet McDowell.
The head of the High Flyers was even shorter
and swarthier than Tim had expected. His hand
was cold and limp and Tim felt a chill run along
his spine as the close-set eyes seemed to bore
into him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Nice field,” commented McDowell.
“Hope we have a good crowd.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ve been giving the show plenty of
publicity,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s good. I’m pulling a new stunt
tomorrow afternoon. It’s a head-on collision at
2,000 feet between two planes. That’s why
I’m wheeling those ancient trainers along.
They’ll go up in smoke tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Pretty risky sort of a stunt, isn’t it?” asked
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not as much so as it sounds. The pilots will
chase each other for a while and then come on
head first. Just before they crash both men
will dive over the side in their chutes.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Who’s going to handle the ships?” asked
Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I‘ll fly one of them. Tommy Larkin will
handle the controls in the other. By the way,
you must meet Larkin. He’s a fine flyer.”</p>

<p class='c007' >At the mention of Larkin’s name, Tim felt
a sickening premonition. It was the fear that
McDowell suspected Larkin of being a federal
agent. It would be so easy for him to crash into
Larkin before the scheduled time.</p>

<p class='c007' >McDowell called to a flyer who was
squirming out of coveralls.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Tommy,” he said, “come over and meet
the flying reporters from the <i>News</i>. There
isn’t enough going on here on the ground, so
these fellows hop around in the clouds
hunting stories.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Glad to know you,” grinned Tommy, as
he shook hands with Tim and Ralph. “I’ve read
a lot about you, first getting the Sky Hawk and
then cleaning up the rustlers in the mountains
west of here.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I was in on the pursuit of the Sky Hawk,”
said Ralph, “but Tim ran down the rustlers
single-handed. He’s getting to be quite a
sleuth.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim saw McDowell’s eyes narrow and he
felt them boring into him. He changed the
trend of the conversation at once.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We brought several cars from the <i>News</i>
down,” he said. “Let’s get out your baggage
and we’ll be glad to take you uptown.”</p>

<p class='c007' >By pre-arrangement, Ralph stepped over to
help McDowell while Tim went with Tommy
Larkin. They reached into the baggage
compartment of Larkin’s monoplane and Tim
whispered, “Prentiss is in town. He got your
message and everything’s set for tomorrow
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Tell him the stuff is in McDowell’s ship
in a special compartment under the floor. Be
careful. I’ve a feeling that McDowell doesn’t
trust me.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then don’t risk your life by going up
tomorrow in one of those old trainers and staging
that crazy stunt.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll keep a sharp lookout. McDowell will
never be able to crash me before I jump. Better
not say anything more or try to talk to me. It
might arouse suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim nodded and picked up the large
suitcase. Together they walked across the ramp
and joined Ralph and McDowell.</p>

<p class='c007' >They left the flyers at the Ransom House
and Tim caught a glimpse of “Mr. Seven” in
the lobby. As soon as the flying circus was out
of town he’d get on the trail of “Mr. Seven”
again and see if he couldn’t learn his real
identity. There was a story there if he could dig it
out.</p>

<p class='c007' >Sunday, the day of the big air show, dawned
clear and windless, ideal for the stunt flying
and just warm enough to insure the attendance
of a large crowd. The first stunts were
scheduled for ten o’clock and half an hour before
Ace McDowell went aloft to do an outside
loop there were more than a thousand cars
parked in the roped off spaces around the field
with more arriving every minute. Tim’s plans
for handling the big crowd were working out
smoothly and he felt some of the tension
slipping from his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007' >At an early morning conference in the
<i>News</i> office with Tommy Larkin and his
chief, it had been decided to arrest McDowell
when he floated down in his chute after the
plane crash. In the meantime, Prentiss would
seize the dope in the flyer’s plane and they
would spring the net from which there would
be no escape for McDowell. Tim and Ralph
were content to be on the sidelines for they
knew the danger in crossing a man like
McDowell.</p>

<p class='c007' >The other flyers in the circus were quiet,
competent chaps, most of them under thirty
and, as far as the narcotics agent could learn,
had no connection with McDowell’s
smuggling activities. The show started with
McDowell’s stunt flight, which left the crowd
gasping and speechless but not so paralyzed but
what as a large number rushed for the ticket
sellers and bought rides in the other planes. The
next stunt program was at one o’clock with
Tommy Larkin going aloft with one of the
wing walkers, who capered all over the ship
in a series of sensational stunts.</p>

<p class='c007' >By early afternoon the crowd had increased
to such an extent that the special police
estimated more than 15,000 were watching the
air show; and the passenger planes were running
to capacity on every flight.</p>

<p class='c007' >Prentiss, who had arrived at the field, was
remaining out of sight in Carl Hunter’s office
and once, when McDowell entered, was forced
to make a hasty retreat into the washroom.</p>

<p class='c007' >The loudspeakers were blaring with the
announcement of the next stunt flight, the crash
of the two planes in mid-air. Tim heard the
words vaguely.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The greatest air thriller ever performed,”
the announcer was informing the crowd.
“Two costly airplanes, speeding at more than
100 miles an hour, will positively crash
head-on at an altitude of 2,000 feet. It’s daring,
death-defying, breath-taking in its thrills.
You’ll be glued to your seats when you see
these ships hurl towards each other piloted by
Ace McDowell and Tommy Larkin, two of
the foremost flyers in the nation. They’ll go
aloft in fifteen minutes. In the meantime,
there’s time for one more ride in the passenger
planes. Let’s go, folks.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The old trainers had been kept in the
hangars where a field crew had given them a
hasty coat of paint that morning. They
glistened bravely in their new dress and the
motors, which were turning over slowly,
sounded sweet.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim inspected the ship that Tommy was to
fly. If it held together long enough to get to
2,000 feet Tommy would be lucky but with a
chute on, he’d be able to get out if anything
happened before they straightened out for the
crash.</p>

<p class='c007' >McDowell’s ship was in better condition.
It was well rigged and Tim, squinting under
the hood, was surprised to see a big Barko
16-cylinder motor turning the prop over. The old
plane’s lines were good. It was still plenty fast
enough to give the average modern ship a good
race. Too bad to sacrifice a sturdy old veteran
like that just to appease the thrill-seekers.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim looked around for Ralph, who had
gone over to the pilot’s room in the
administration building. His companion was nowhere in
sight but McDowell and Tommy, their chute
packs banging awkwardly against their legs,
were making their way toward the hangar.
McDowell’s own monoplane had been rolled
inside.</p>

<p class='c007' >McDowell was giving Tommy final
instructions as they entered the hangar.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll take our time getting up to 2,000,”
he said. “Then we’ll circle around and make
several false rushes at each other. After three
or four times I’ll waggle my wings and the next
time we’ll let them go. We’ll be west of the
field where the ships won’t do any damage
when they crash. Stick with them as long as
you can and then go overboard. Got that all
straight?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tommy, a little grim, nodded.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll handle my end of it,” he said, climbing
into the cockpit of the ancient trainer.</p>

<p class='c007' >McDowell, eyes narrowed to slits as hard
as steel, looked at the crowd.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’re going to get a real thrill,” he said
savagely, smacking his clenched hands
together.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim looked at him curiously. McDowell
outwardly wasn’t nervous yet he appeared to
be laboring under a great strain. Could he
suspect Tommy’s real identity? The question
burned itself into Tim’s mind. If McDowell
was suspicious he might fake the crash and
after Tommy went over the side, roar away in
the trainer. That might explain why the old
ship had such a powerful motor.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim stepped over to Tommy’s ship and
climbed up so he could yell into Tommy’s ear.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t like the way McDowell looks,” he
said. “Be careful.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tommy nodded.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m not taking any chances this afternoon.
The first thing that looks funny will find me
going over the side in the chute.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The loud speakers were blaring. The field
was being cleared and the tension in the crowd
increased.</p>

<p class='c007' >“In the Number one plane,” boomed the
announcer, “is Ace McDowell. In the Number
two ship is Tommy Larkin. Here they come.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The flyers gunned their motors and the old
ships, gleaming under their coat of hastily
applied paint, rolled out on the ramp.</p>

<p class='c007' >A mighty roar went up from the crowd.
The field was finally clear of the passenger
carrying ships. The signalman in the control
tower waved his flag at Tommy. The young
flyer opened his throttle, the venerable craft
waggled its wings, felt the call of the skies, and
rolled smoothly down the runway. Tommy
took his time in getting off the field. With as
little strain as possible on the ancient wings he
lifted his plane into the air.</p>

<p class='c007' >The flag waved again and Ace, pushing his
throttle ahead hard, flipped the tail of his ship
up and went scooting after the leisurely
soaring Tommy.</p>

<p class='c007' >The planes climbed in easy circles with Ace
going up much faster than Tommy. They were
up a thousand feet when Tim felt a tug at his
arm and turned to face the narcotics inspector.
“Give me a hand and we’ll see what we can
find in McDowell’s plane,” said Prentiss. They
hastened into the hangar and climbed into the
cabin. Tommy had given them the exact
location of the hidden compartment and without
wasting time Prentiss took an iron bar and
smashed his way to it. With eager fingers he
ripped away the splintered wood of the
top and delved inside. When his hands came
into view again they held small white
containers.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ve got McDowell with the goods this
time,” said Prentiss. “When he comes down
I’ll arrest him. I’ll turn this over to the field
manager to place in his safe while I’m out
getting McDowell.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Prentiss turned back to Tim as he started for
the administration building.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Better come along when I go after
McDowell,” he said. “I may need some help.
Bring your friend with you.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I will if I can find him,” promised Tim.
“He disappeared about half an hour ago and
I haven’t seen him since.”</p>

<p class='c007' >A commotion near the pilot’s quarters drew
his attention just then. Someone broke away
and started running toward him. It was Ralph,
staggering slightly, and holding a blood-stained
handkerchief to his head.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch4' class='c005'>CHAPTER FOUR<br /> <br />The Mad Pursuit</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >Something was radically wrong and
Tim, forgetting for the moment the
drama soon to be enacted in the sky, ran
toward Ralph. He caught his friend in his arms as
he stumbled. Blood was flowing freely from
a long gash on the right side of Ralph’s head.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ralph was on the verge of unconsciousness
but he made a heroic effort to speak.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s Tommy,” he whispered. “McDowell’s
slashed his chute. If he ever steps over the side
he’s gone.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim’s face whitened at Ralph’s alarming
words. Tommy’s chute slashed! He glanced
aloft. The planes were almost up to 2,000 feet.
In a few more minutes they would be rushing
headlong toward each other and Tommy
would step over the side to hurl like a falling
star to the ground. Tim’s eyes closed to shut
out the image which flashed across his mind.</p>

<p class='c007' >Prentiss reached his side.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s happened?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t know exactly,” said Tim, “but
McDowell’s slashed Tommy’s chute with a
knife. Take care of Ralph. I’m going up to stop
Tommy.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Take him into my office,” directed Carl
Hunter, who had arrived on the run and
overheard Tim’s words.</p>

<p class='c007' >Prentiss gathered Ralph in his arms and
stalked toward the administration building
while Tim and Hunter ran down the ramp.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim scanned the field. It would be
impossible to get the fast Jupiter which the <i>News</i>
owned or the American Ace which he and
Ralph operated out of their hangars. He turned
toward the other planes on the field. It would
take a fast ship to get up there in time to stop
the crash of the two planes. His eyes rested
on McDowell’s own monoplane. It was trim
and fast and the 300 horsepower motor was
capable of pulling it almost vertically skyward.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll take McDowell’s plane,” he told
Hunter. The field manager gave him a hand
and between them they whipped the ship
around and headed it toward the open field.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim climbed inside, stumbled over the
smashed boards which had hidden the secret
compartment, and sat down in the pilot’s seat.
The controls were slightly different from the
ships he had been accustomed to flying but he
knew he could handle the plane without
trouble. He glanced at the gas gauge. The tank
was a quarter full.</p>

<p class='c007' >One of the High Flyers ran toward him,
protesting on the use of the monoplane, but
Hunter waved him back with a curt
explanation. Tim turned on the starter and the motor,
still warm, caught on the first turn.</p>

<p class='c007' >He was about to give the ship the gun when
Prentiss ran toward him, a rifle in hand. The
narcotics inspector clambered into the cabin
and slammed the door.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Let’s go,” he shouted. Tim nodded and
opened the throttle. The field had been cleared
for the stunt and he sped out of the hanger and
rocketed into the air. With the motor taking a
full flow of gas, he shot the speedy monoplane
into the air. They danced skyward in a crazy,
climbing turn that saw the earth dropping away
from them.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How’s Ralph?” Tim shouted.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’ll be all right. Got a nasty bump on his
head but there’s a doctor patching him up now.
He’s weak from loss of blood more than
anything else.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim, with the stick jammed back between
his knees, was watching the drama of the
circling planes. He was careful to keep behind
McDowell as much as possible.</p>

<p class='c007' >The old trainers had levelled off and were
jockeying for the first dash toward each other.
Tim’s hands gripped the stick hard as he saw
them start. Then he relaxed a little. Ace hadn’t
waggled his wings. There would be no crash
this time.</p>

<p class='c007' >The old ships soared past each other with
little room to spare and Tim almost pulled his
own ship higher by the sheer tension he was on.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tommy was circling slowly for another
dash toward Ace when Tim flashed past him
waving frantically. In pantomime he went
through the motions of jumping and then
shook his head vigorously while Prentiss
attempted to indicate to Tommy that his chute
was damaged.</p>

<p class='c007' >As he flashed by a second time Tim caught
the look of alarm in Tommy’s eyes and saw
the other examining the chute pack. There was
the sudden roar of another motor and
McDowell, forgotten for the moment, shot
down toward them.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s after us!” cried Prentiss.</p>

<p class='c007' >Without looking Tim sent the monoplane
into a tight roll and the wings of the old trainer
almost brushed their landing gear as they
flopped over. A bullet crashed through the
bottom of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s on to us,” said Tim grimly, “but we’ll
keep him busy until Tommy can land that
crate of his.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim whipped the monoplane out of the roll.
Below him McDowell was hard after Larkin’s
plane. It was evident that he was out to destroy
the other flyer if at all possible. He was going
at Tommy head-on again. This time there
seemed little doubt but what the ships would
crash in spite of all that Tommy could do to
escape the trap. McDowell’s plane was too
fast. He met every maneuver of Tommy’s and
played him one better.</p>

<p class='c007' >For the moment he had forgotten Tim in his
terrible concentration of destroying the flyer
he felt sure had turned in the evidence which
would lead to his arrest. If he had not forgotten
Tim, he had sadly underrated the flying ability
and nerve of the reporter.</p>

<p class='c007' >With wind screaming past the struts and
motor on full, Tim dove headlong toward
McDowell. Some sixth sense must have warned
his prey for McDowell threw a startled glance
over his shoulder. Instantly he changed tactics
and left Tommy to make a hurried landing
with the old trainer while he took up the new
feud with his unforeseen foe.</p>

<p class='c007' >Prentiss opened the windows on the right
side of the cabin and steadied the rifle. There
was a grim purpose written on the tensed lips.
If he could line his sights on McDowell, the
rifle would spit flame and death. Crouched on
the floor of the cabin, finger crooked on the
trigger, cheek resting on the gunstock, he
waited for the chance he felt was sure to come.</p>

<p class='c007' >Below them the startled thousands watched
the deadly duel, craned their necks as the planes
twisted and darted through the air, and at times
seemed almost to crash before one of them
flipped this way or that just in time to avert
a catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim and Prentiss had the advantage of a
slightly faster plane but McDowell had a chute.
If they crashed he would have a chance of
escaping while the flying reporter and the
narcotics inspector would be pinned in the falling
wreckage of their ship.</p>

<p class='c007' >McDowell was playing the game for his
life. In spite of their danger Tim thrilled to the
masterful flying which it required to escape
the mad rushes of the other.</p>

<p class='c007' >For half an hour the grim battle went on.
Then it ceased as suddenly as it had started.
McDowell, giving his plane a full gun, darted
away southwest. He was making a break for
safety. With a heavy bank of clouds rolling up
in the west, night would drop its mantle early.
There was just a chance that he might remain
aloft until he could find shelter in the darkness.
Tim saw through McDowell’s strategy at once.
Undoubtedly the other had a full tank of gas
and since the old trainers usually had large
tanks, sufficient to keep the ancient craft aloft
until after nightfall. The flying reporter
glanced again at the gauge on the instrument
board of the monoplane. He didn’t need to. He
knew what the needle indicated without
looking but perhaps there had been some mistake.</p>

<p class='c007' >The gauge showed only an eighth of a tank of
gas. Another half hour in the air; perhaps a
little more. Then they would be forced down
and McDowell would wing on alone.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tom leaned back and shouted to the
inspector.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ve got only enough gas for another
half hour. Want to land now, fill up the tank,
and then try to overtake McDowell, or keep
after him until our fuel gives out?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Something might happen to his ship before
our gas gives out. We’ll keep going as long as
we can,” Prentiss shouted back.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim nodded and set out in full pursuit. In
three minutes he was on McDowell’s tail and
he throttled down. No use to push the motor
any harder than necessary.</p>

<p class='c007' >The minutes droned on. Tim checked their
direction. It was obvious that McDowell was
heading for the border. It was a long hop;
impossible in one jump, and he wondered where
the pilot ahead of him intended to refuel. He
probably had some out-of-the-way airport
where he could come down, replenish his
supply of gas and oil, and get away without being
reported.</p>

<p class='c007' >Fifteen minutes went by the clock. The
needle on the gas gauge dropped lower.
Probably McDowell, up ahead, was chuckling for
he certainly knew the amount of fuel in the
monoplane he had left behind.</p>

<p class='c007' >Prentiss tapped Tim on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How much longer?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not more than 15 minutes.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Close in on him and I’ll see if this rifle can’t
convince him that it’s time to come down.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim’s right hand jammed the throttle on
full and the trim monoplane leaped ahead,
overhauling the old trainer rapidly.</p>

<p class='c007' >McDowell, hearing the deeper drone of the
motor behind him, looked back at them. Tim
banked to give Prentiss a clear shot and the
federal agent pressed the trigger. Tim could
hear the sharp spats of the gun as the bullets
sped on their way. Holes appeared in the
fuselage of McDowell’s ship. Prentiss was shooting
better. McDowell, pointing an automatic at
them, emptied the magazine. His aim was wild
and not a bullet struck the monoplane.</p>

<p class='c007' >McDowell put the old biplane into a dive
and Tim promptly followed. Twisting and
turning, they resumed the battle they had
waged over the Atkinson airport. Tim was
flying rings around McDowell now and
Prentiss pumped shot after shot toward the
biplane but the air was rough and it was hard
to gauge the distance accurately.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Concentrate on his motor,” Tim shouted.
“We can’t stay up more than five minutes more
and you may be able to put his ship out of
commission.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Prentiss filled the magazine of the rifle again
and, firing steadily, directed his bullets toward
the motor of the biplane. Tim could see the
black splashes as the bullets struck the cowling.
There was just a chance that he might be able
to disable McDowell’s motor.</p>

<p class='c007' >The motor of their own ship coughed. Tim
switched on the emergency tank and it barked
steadily again. Their minutes in the air were
numbered for he had no way of knowing
whether the emergency tank was full or how
much it held.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m going to try to bring him down,” Tim
yelled at Prentiss.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“See if I can’t run my wheels through his
prop. Hang on.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Won’t that wreck your landing gear?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll have to take a chance on that. If it
does we’ll get down someway. Are you game?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Go ahead,” said the inspector grimly. “I’ll
try it once. There may not be a second time.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll get you down all in one piece,” grinned
Tim. Then he turned to the job at hand.</p>

<p class='c007' >McDowell was just a little above them and
about a thousand feet ahead. Gunning the
motor hard, Tim climbed above their quarry
and with the motor on full, dove headlong for
the biplane. McDowell must have sensed what
was in Tim’s mind for he stood up in his
cockpit and took deliberate aim with the automatic.
Bullets plunked into the wing of the
monoplane, but Tim kept on. Prentiss’s rifle was
silent for the moment for at that angle he was
unable to fire.</p>

<p class='c007' >Down they dropped like an eagle after its
prey. McDowell dove back into the cockpit
just as the monoplane crashed down on him,
the wheels of the ship above almost raking his
head. Tim steeled himself for the expected
crash as the propeller of the biplane bit into the
landing gear but it did not come. By some trick
of magic which Tim would never know
McDowell dropped the biplane down almost
ten feet at the last moment. Or perhaps fate
had taken a hand and the ship had struck an air
pocket. At any rate the monoplane sped on
overhead and McDowell was safe again.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What happened?” asked Prentiss.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim shook his head. “I don’t know. Maybe
the biplane hit rough air and dropped. I thought
surely we had him that time.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The motor coughed, rapped out a few more
revolutions, and then died.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s about all for us,” said Tim bitterly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“And there goes McDowell,” said the
inspector.</p>

<p class='c007' >The flying reporter scanned the ground for
a safe landing place. They were up a little
better than 4,000 feet. To their right was a
small town and a fair-sized pasture at one edge,
flanked by a white highway. Tim nosed the
monoplane down. As they glided toward the
field he caught the sound of another airplane
motor. He glanced up. Perhaps McDowell
was coming back. But McDowell’s ship was
winging steadily along on the 1,200-mile hop
to the border.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Someone back of us,” said Prentiss. There
was no need to shout now and the inspector’s
voice sounded unnatural.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim glanced back. The ship was familiar.
His heart leaped. It was the fast Jupiter owned
by the <i>News</i>. Someone had managed to get it
out of the hangar and was coming to help them.</p>

<p class='c007' >The flying reporter opened the window on
his left and waved wildly, pointing downward.
The pilot of the other plane waggled his wings
in understanding and dropped toward the
pasture with Tim following him down.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Looks like Tommy Larkin in the other
plane,” said the inspector.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s the <i>News</i>’ ship and I don’t care
who’s flying it,” said Tim, “just as long as it’s
got a full tank of gas. McDowell is going to be
in for a surprise when we shoot up in the
Jupiter. That’s an airplane.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The pasture proved surprisingly smooth and
they rolled across the field. The pilot who had
brought in the Jupiter had it swung around and
had it ready for them when they tumbled from
the cabin of the monoplane.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Tommy!” cried the inspector. “Great
work, boy!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I couldn’t stay out of this shindig,” grinned
the flyer McDowell had planned to destroy.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What a break,” chuckled Tim. “Plenty of
gas?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“The tank’s full to overflowing. That’s
some plane; fast and easy to handle.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll have to leave you here, Tommy,”
said the inspector. “Maybe you can get gas in
this town and fly back to Atkinson.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll make out all right,” grinned Tommy.
“You fellows get after McDowell. Gosh, I’d
like to see his face when you come barging
down on him again.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s heading for the border,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yeah. That old tub carried about a ton of
fuel and he’s got a field way over in western
Kansas where he can land and refuel without
trouble. He knows it so well he can even land
at night but unless I miss my guess he won’t be
in the air by nightfall.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim climbed into the Jupiter and the
inspector scrambled in after him. Tim checked the
gauges, tank nearly full of gas, motor temp
right, oil pressure up. He released the brakes,
opened the throttle, and waved to Tommy as
the plane shot down the field and rocketed
away in pursuit of McDowell, whose plane
now was only the tiniest of dots in the
southwestern sky.</p>

<p class='c007' >The Jupiter was fast and Tim cruised along
at an easy, mile-consuming 150 miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll overtake McDowell in no time,”
he told the inspector, who was busy refilling
the magazine of the rifle.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve only about twenty rounds of
ammunition left,” shouted Prentiss. “My shooting will
have to improve.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The dot in the sky ahead grew in size and
took on the shape of an airplane. Tim was
flying high and there was little chance that
McDowell would see them until they were
on top of him.</p>

<p class='c007' >The flying reporter’s thoughts went back to
Atkinson. He wondered about Ralph and the
wound on his head, and there was no mercy in
his heart as he guided the Jupiter on the now
relentless chase after the fleeing McDowell.</p>

<p class='c007' >The outline of the old biplane grew larger
and larger as the fast-flying Jupiter cut down
the distance. Tim had planned a new campaign
of action. In the Jupiter, knowing every
movement and capability of the ship, he felt
confident that he could ride McDowell into the
ground, out-maneuver and out-speed him until
the other would welcome the chance to fight it
out below.</p>

<p class='c007' >The Jupiter was flying a thousand feet above
the old trainer when Tim dropped the nose
down and opened the throttle for a power dive.
As they swooped down, he saw McDowell
look up, saw the surprise and alarm on the
other’s face. Then they were by with less than
ten feet to spare between the ships. Tim
climbed the Jupiter dizzily until he was back
on McDowell’s tail, riding it hard and close.
The flyer ahead emptied another magazine at
them and then threw his automatic away in
disgust. He was out of ammunition. Now it
was a case of plane against plane, pilot against
pilot, and nerve pitted against nerve for
Prentiss was unable to shoot now.</p>

<p class='c007' >Closer and closer Tim drove the Jupiter. He
was just above and behind the biplane, riding
it down, relentlessly and with grim intent.
McDowell twisted and turned, but always the
cream and green biplane rode his tail. He
dodged to the right and then to the left, looped,
barrel-rolled, but it was all in vain. Tim guessed
his every maneuver and went him one better.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Country’s getting rougher,” cried Prentiss.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Bad place for a forced landing,” agreed
Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >They were flying at a little under 3,000
feet and Tim was riding McDowell’s plane
down, foot by foot. It was a slow and
nerve-wracking process but it seemed destined for
success. Once in a while he would veer his ship
enough to let Prentiss get in a shot, but none of
them found their mark.</p>

<p class='c007' >The air was getting rougher. Even the
steady, easy-flying Jupiter was rocking and
pitching and Tim could see that the old
biplane ahead of them was bucking hard.</p>

<p class='c007' >Prentiss turned around.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Look at the biplane’s wings,” he cried.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim watched closely. The wings were
flapping, threatening to break loose from the ship
at any moment. The chase was nearly over.
McDowell would be forced down. Tim
glanced at the country below. It was rough
and broken, almost impossible for a safe
landing.</p>

<p class='c007' >A startled cry from Prentiss drew his
attention back to the biplane. The old ship was
breaking up! McDowell had been pushing it
too hard, the spins and rolls and loops had been
more than the ancient spruce could stand. The
right wing was giving way, the top section
drooping down in the lower one.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch5' class='c005'>CHAPTER FIVE<br /> <br />Death Rides the Air</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >McDowell was making a game fight,
attempting to nurse the old craft over
the rough country to the more level reaches
ahead. Tim eased up on the throttle of the
Jupiter, like the eagle giving its prey a
moment’s respite before the last swoop.</p>

<p class='c007' >The left wing of the old trainer was
wobbling uncertainly now. The end was near and
still they were over the rough country.</p>

<p class='c007' >Fascinated, Tim and Prentiss watched the
drama ahead of them. The biplane was weaving
from side to side, the right upper wing now
almost touching the lower one. With a rending
of linen and wood, the wing tore loose and
floated away in the backwash of the propeller.
Then the lower right wing collapsed under the
strain and the ship started to fall away rapidly.</p>

<p class='c007' >McDowell, game to the last, methodically
prepared to go over the side.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’d better hurry,” shouted Prentiss.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim glanced at the altimeter. They were
still up 2,500 feet. There was plenty of time
for McDowell to bail out and float down safely.
The dope smuggler poised himself on the edge
of the cockpit as the ship started to spin.</p>

<p class='c007' >He waved at them in sheer bravado and then
dived headlong from the plane. McDowell
somersaulted once, then jerked the rip-cord.
The chute pack unfolded and Tim and Prentiss
saw the silken umbrella billow out. It caught
the wind and unfolded. Then, before startled
eyes, they saw the chute collapse and
McDowell plummeted from their sight.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Don’t look!” Tim shouted at Prentiss. He
closed his own eyes, but even then the image
danced in his mind. In the single second in
which the chute had opened he had seen the
long slit in the silk. In some unexplained manner
McDowell had knifed his own chute instead of
Tommy Larkin’s when he had plotted the
death of Larkin at the Atkinson airport. It was
a just vengeance but a merciless one.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim opened his eyes. Prentiss, white-faced
and shaking, looked at him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Is there anything we can do?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not a thing. We’ll find out where the
county seat is and notify the sheriff. That’s
about all that can be done.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim checked their position. The county
seat was about fifteen miles back on their
return to Atkinson. The afternoon shadows were
lengthening when they dropped down on the
tiny airport on the outskirts of Walford.
Inspector Prentiss climbed stiffly from the plane.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll find a phone,” he said. “You might as
well wait here.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim nodded and cut the motor. There were
no attendants at the field and he was glad that
there was plenty of fuel left in the Jupiter’s
tanks to take them back to Atkinson.</p>

<p class='c007' >Half an hour later the inspector returned.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I located the sheriff and explained what had
happened,” he said. “Everything will be taken
care of. A party will leave at once to hunt for
McDowell so we might as well go on back to
Atkinson.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim pulled the Jupiter into the air just as the
sun dipped behind the horizon. The earth
below was shrouded in the half-light of early
evening as they roared steadily along at 2,500
feet and some of the strain which had gripped
him during the afternoon slipped from his
weary shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007' >The mantle shrouding the earth deepened.
Stars came out overhead and he switched on
the wing lights. A crimson patch on the
eastern horizon indicated where the moon was
struggling upward. Clusters of lights passed
beneath them and occasionally the streaking lights
of a car could be seen. It was restful up there
away from the earthy smells.</p>

<p class='c007' >An hour slipped by and the lights of
Atkinson glowed ahead. The airport was outlined in
the red, green and white lights that marked its
boundaries and indicated to an incoming pilot
the runaways. Smoothly, easily, Tim dropped
the Jupiter down and the swift biplane rolled
up to the ramp near the administration
building. Tim blinked in the glare of the bright
electrics.</p>

<p class='c007' >A familiar figure loomed out of the glare. It
was Ralph, a bandage around his head, but able
to move under his own power.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Where’s McDowell?” asked Ralph. “Did
he get away?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim looked at Prentiss. The inspector spoke
slowly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“No, he didn’t get away,” he said as Tommy
Larkin joined the group. “His ship started
breaking up and he went over the side in his
chute. The chute didn’t open.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Didn’t what?” asked Tommy incredulously.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Someone had ripped it open with a knife.”</p>

<p class='c007' >A grim smile flickered around Tommy’s lips.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I guess I can explain that,” he said.
“McDowell and I use exactly the same type of
chutes and our packs look so much alike we can
hardly tell them apart. He ripped one of the
chutes, folded it back, and then picked it up
himself. Fate certainly took a hand in the events
around here this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What happened to you?” Tim asked
Ralph, who was leaning against the biplane.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Plenty,” grinned Ralph. “I caught
McDowell in the pilot’s room with a knife in his
hand and the chute ripped. He was just ready
to repack the umbrella. When he saw me he
came at me with both hands going and I went
down in a heap. He must have socked me with
a wrench when I was down for I’ve got about
a two inch gash on the right side of my head.
The next thing I knew I heard planes buzzing
around and woke up enough to come out and
give the alarm.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I guess we can write ‘finis’ to this smuggling
case,” said the inspector slowly. “I hadn’t
expected it would end in quite this fashion.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What will the other members of the flying
circus do?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Half of them have left the field already,”
said Tommy. “They’re pretty much of a
happy-go-lucky outfit. Some of them
suspected that McDowell was smuggling but they
wouldn’t turn in information on him. They’ll
catch on with some other circus.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“My head feels like someone was using a
trip hammer on it,” said Ralph. “I’m going
home and to bed.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Here comes a reporter from the <i>Advance</i>,”
interjected Tim. “He’ll probably want to
know all about the McDowell case,” the last
words were directed at the inspector.</p>

<p class='c007' >Mogridge, police reporter for the <i>Advance</i>,
nodded to Tim and Ralph.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’d like to get all the facts on this story,” he
said to Inspector Prentiss.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sorry,” smiled the inspector, “but since
the <i>News</i>’ men played such an important part
I’m afraid that the story will have to be
exclusive with them.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then you haven’t anything to say?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not a word.”</p>

<p class='c007' >It was obvious from the set of the inspector’s
chin that no amount of argument or cajolery
would change his mind. Mogridge shrugged
and walked away.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thanks, Inspector,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It was the least I could do,” replied the
federal agent. “Without your assistance
McDowell would undoubtedly have succeeded in
his dash for the border.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ralph took a cab for home while Tim
superintended the return of the Jupiter to its hangar.
Then, with the inspector and Tommy Larkin,
he climbed into the <i>News</i>’ car he had used that
morning and started uptown.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This is a long ways from the McDowell
case,” said Tim, “but I’ve got a pet mystery all
my own.” Briefly he told the inspector about
“Mr. Seven.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll be glad to have a look at him in the
morning,” said Inspector Prentiss. “I’ve a
faculty for remembering names and faces. Perhaps
I can help you out.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then I’ll meet you here after breakfast,”
said Tim as the federal men left the car in front
of the Ransom House.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Right,” agreed the inspector. “Say about
eight-thirty. Good night.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good night,” replied Tim as he eased in the
clutch and headed the car for the garage
behind the <i>News</i> building.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was getting late, but tomorrow he would
be on the trail of “Mr. Seven.” In spite of the
let-down after the strain of the afternoon, he
went up to the editorial office, switched on the
light over his desk, and wrote the story of
McDowell.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was a smashing action story, tense and
alive to every bit of the great drama which had
been played in the air. Page after page of copy
rolled from Tim’s typewriter as he spun his
thread of verbs and adjectives, creating a living,
pulsating picture with his words. He sat back
exhausted when he had finished the last line and
banged out the last period. He was too tired to
read it over and he tossed the handful of sheets
on the copy desk, turned out the light, and
somehow got to his room where he tumbled
into bed.</p>

<p class='c007' >When Tim awoke the next morning the sun
was streaming through the windows. He
glanced at his wrist watch. Eight o’clock. Time
for him to be at the office. He had overslept.</p>

<p class='c007' >Seizing the phone he called the copy desk.
Dan Watkins answered.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Did you get my story?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll say we did. There’ll be an extra on the
street before nine o’clock. Great yarn.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I overslept,” explained Tim, “and I’ve got
an appointment to meet Inspector Prentiss at
the Ransom House in half an hour. If the office
can stagger through another hour without
me I’ll have breakfast before I meet the
inspector.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“After the yarn you turned in last night I
guess you can take the day off if you want it,”
said Watkins.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim stopped at a restaurant for breakfast on
his way to the hotel and reached the lobby of
the Ransom House exactly at eight-thirty.
Inspector Prentiss was equally prompt.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Let’s have a look at your mysterious ‘Mr.
Seven’ and see if we can’t strip a little of the
mystery from him,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim went up to the desk.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Is ‘Mr. Seven’ in?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sorry, he left last night,” replied the clerk.
Tim’s hopes crashed.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Didn’t he leave a forwarding address?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“No, he checked out of his room but he left
his baggage with the porter.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then he’s coming back soon?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I presume so.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim went to the check room to question the
porter. The information gained there was a
little more helpful.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes sir, there’s ‘Mr. Seven’s’ bags over
there,” said the porter. “He said he’d be gone
several days and for me to keep a close watch
on them. I guess they must be pretty
important ’cause he gave me two dollars in advance for
watching them.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Didn’t you hear him say where he was
going?” pressed Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He didn’t say a thing except ask where
there was a rent-a-car garage?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What did you tell him?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I gave him the name of several. Kelleys and
Brackens.”</p>

<p class='c007' >There was no further information to be
gained from the porter and Tim rejoined the
inspector, to whom he recounted the slight
information he had gleaned.</p>

<p class='c007' >“‘Mr. Seven’ appears to be an interesting
character. I’d like to stay here and help you
run him down, but I’ve another case in the
southern part of the state that is needing
immediate attention. Sorry I can’t be of any real
help.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim watched the inspector depart with a
sinking heart. He had counted more than he
cared to admit upon the ability of the federal
officer to strip away the secrecy which had
surrounded “Mr. Seven” since his arrival in
Atkinson.</p>

<p class='c007' >But tracing down “Mr. Seven” wasn’t a
newspaper assignment and Tim turned his steps
toward the office where Ralph eagerly awaited
news of the visit to the Ransom House.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s the good word?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim shook his head glumly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“There isn’t any. ‘Mr. Seven’ checked out
last night but left his baggage at the hotel.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then he’s coming back?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Undoubtedly, but that is another question,
and what’s more, he may be doing something
right now that is big news.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Why don’t you go to Carson and get a
couple of days off. That would give you a real
chance to run down this story.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“The managing editor would probably
laugh at my hunch. Nope, I’ll keep my eye on
the story and try to grab on to ‘Mr. Seven’
when he comes back to the hotel.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ralph had an assignment in an outlying
district of the city and he left the office at once
while Tim sat down to write a column of
aviation news.</p>

<p class='c007' >The chief copyreader left his desk and
joined Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I overheard what you were telling Ralph,”
he said. “Too bad that ‘Mr. Seven’ got away
before Inspector Prentiss could see him.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Just my luck,” muttered Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What are you going to do next?” asked
Dan.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Keep a close check at the hotel and also find
out where ‘Mr. Seven’ rented a car. It’s from
one of two places and I may be able to learn
where he has gone.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch6' class='c005'>CHAPTER SIX<br /> <br />Another Visitor</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >The battery of presses in the basement
awoke with a roar and newsboys scurried
on to the street, their shrill cries of “Extra!
Extra!” echoing between the lanes of buildings.</p>

<p class='c007' >A copy boy came up from the press room
with an armful of papers so fresh the ink was
soft and smeary on the page. He handed one to
the chief copyreader and another to Tim, then
proceeded down the room leaving them at the
various desks where they were eagerly scanned
by reporters and copyreaders.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You turned in a great story on the pursuit
and death of McDowell,” said the copyreader.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thanks, Dan,” smiled Tim. “Coming
from you, those words mean something.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The managing editor stuck his head out of
his office and, seeing Tim, beckoned to him.
In one hand he held a copy of the extra.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Fine work,” Carson told the flying
reporter, “but I guess we have gotten in the habit of
expecting good stories from you.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“The answer to that is easy,” grinned Tim.
“I like reporting and if you really like a thing I
believe you can do it well.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Any flying assignments for you today?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not so far.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m glad of that. After your gruelling flight
of yesterday it will do you good to be out of the
air for at least a day.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim returned to his desk and sat down to the
routine task of gleaning enough aviation news
to make an interesting column. He always tried
to work a day in advance on the column. It was
well after mid-forenoon when he had
completed the column and turned it in at the
copydesk.</p>

<p class='c007' >The city editor, Ed Campbell, a
comparative newcomer on the staff, looked up from his
assignment book.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve just received a wire that June
O’Malley, new star of the Hollywood Follies, is
coming through on the noon plane eastbound. Can
you hop down to the field for an interview?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Right away,” promised Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Better take a cameraman.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim stopped at the photo department and a
photographer was assigned to accompany him.</p>

<p class='c007' >Interviewing the latest sensation of the film
capital was little more than routine and Tim
found that the girl had little that she could or
would say. The photographer got several snaps
and they returned uptown where Tim
managed, by hard work, to grind out half a column
on the visit of June O’Malley to the airport.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This is poor stuff and I’m making no
apologies,” he said as he laid the sheet and a half of
copy on the copydesk. “She didn’t have
anything to say and I don’t believe she could have
said it if she had.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’re usually pretty poor copy,”
nodded Dan, “but you should kick on a few
assignments like this after your thrilling flight of
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I guess you’re right at that,” nodded Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I know what’s the matter,” said Dan. “You
can’t get thoughts of ‘Mr. Seven’ out of your
head.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’d better have a sign painted and start
in the mind reading business,” grinned Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It didn’t take a mind reader to figure that
one out.” Dan dialed the automatic telephone.
“Ransom House? This is the <i>News</i>. Has ‘Mr.
Seven’ returned?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not back yet,” said Dan as he hung up the
receiver. “Let’s go out to lunch?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim agreed and they had their noonday
meal at a nearby restaurant.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How far are the garages where ‘Mr.
Seven’ might have rented a car?” asked Dan.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Only three or four blocks. The porter at
the Ransom House recommended both
Kelleys and Brackens.”</p>

<p class='c007' >They paid their checks and Tim turned
toward the <i>News</i>, but Dan stopped him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Things are light today. We’ll take a few
extra minutes and see what we can learn at the
garages.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Kelleys, the first rent-a-car agency visited,
could supply no information but at Brackens
they found their visit more fruitful.</p>

<p class='c007' >The man in charge of the office consulted his
records and informed them that on the
Saturday night previous a “Mr. G. Seven” had
rented one of their best cars, putting up a cash
deposit of $100 since he intended to take the
car outside the city limits.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim described “Mr. Seven” in detail.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s the man,” said the garage employe
firmly. “There’s no mistake about it; he’s got
one of our cars. Is he in some kind of trouble?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not as far as we know,” replied Tim. “Did
you hear him say where he was going?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“No, but I saw him looking at the state map
on the wall over there. He was a little different
from the average run of our customers and I
kept an eye on him. He was looking at the
roads leading into the Cedar river country.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“But there aren’t any really good roads in
that part of the state,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s one reason why I noticed him
looking at that section of the map. He made a
detailed study of it, but never asked a question of
me nor any of the boys who serviced the car for
him.”</p>

<p class='c007' >There was no further information to be
gained at the garage and Tim and the chief
copyreader returned to the <i>News</i> office.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Looks like you’re on the trail of a real
story,” commented Dan. “What’s going to be
the next angle of attack?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“The files. I’m going to start with this month
and go back into them day by day. Somewhere
I’m sure there will be a picture that will give me
the identity of ‘Mr. Seven.’”</p>

<p class='c007' >The afternoon passed in routine tasks but
when the final edition rolled from the press
Tim went over to the room which housed the
paper’s library and ordered out the files for the
last year. When they were available he carried
the large, sturdily bound books to his desk
where he placed them one on top of another.
Ralph’s desk was not in use and he opened the
last volume of the file and placed it there.
Drawing up a chair he started the slow task of
scrutinizing every picture which had appeared
in the <i>News</i> for the last year.</p>

<p class='c007' >The job was doubly difficult since one of the
boasts of the <i>News</i> was that it carried an
interesting picture on every page. Members of the
staff left the office, one by one, until Tim alone
remained, bent over the file and scanning the
pages as he riffled through them.</p>

<p class='c007' >Daylight faded and he snapped on the light
over Ralph’s desk. Under the glow of the
electric he continued his task until his shoulders
ached from the continued strain of bending
over. When he finally straightened up it was
7:30 o’clock and the telephone was buzzing.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Atkinson <i>News</i>,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hello, Tim,” said Carl Hunter. “There’s
a big amphibian coming in within the next half
hour. Thought you might want a story. We
don’t get many ships like that here.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Who’s on board?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Haven’t got anything on that yet. Will
you be down?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Right away,” promised Tim. He closed the
file, snapped off the light and hurried around
to the garage in the rear where he signed an
order for one of the <i>News</i>’ cars.</p>

<p class='c007' >Hunter was waiting for him at the airport.
In one hand he held one of the pink slips on
which the radiograms were copied.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Just got a report on the ownership of the
amphib,” said the field manager. “It belongs to
some fellow by the name of Sladek in New
York City.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Is it Jack Sladek?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Can’t say. The message asking for
refueling here is just signed Sladek. You know
someone by that name?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“No, but I’ve read a lot about a Jack Sladek
of New York. He’s something of an
international figure; been mixed up in a lot of different
things, South American revolutions, Arctic
explorations, underwater treasure hunts and rum
running when that business was profitable. I’ve
seen feature stories in eastern papers that credit
Sladek with having made a fortune in deals
that are just inside the law.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ll have a chance to see him first hand,”
grinned Hunter, “for the ship was over
Spencer half an hour ago. It should be here in
another fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s just time enough for me to get a
lunch. I got interested in a little work at the
office and forgot to go out and get supper.”
Tim ordered a hot lunch and while he ate
scanned the last edition of the <i>Advance</i>, the
rival newspaper. He chuckled once or twice
as he read the story of the pursuit of McDowell.
The <i>Advance</i> had only the sketchiest of details
and all of the rest of the story was obviously
the product of the imagination of Mogridge,
the reporter who had been assigned to the
story. It could not compare with the brilliant
accurately written story which Tim had woven
for the <i>News</i> and which had been featured on
the front page through all the editions that day.
As Tim finished his lunch the drone of twin
motors sounded high overhead. The amphibian
was coming in. He stepped out of the lunchroom.
The riding lights of the plane were
visible as it circled to come down into the wind.
Tim walked over and stood beside Hunter as
the big ship dropped down and rolled to a stop
on the ramp.</p>

<p class='c007' >The amphibian was a beauty, trimmed in
green and silver, and with a large cabin.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Twin-engines, 575 horsepower each,” said
Hunter. “That’s a high-speed ship.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Stream-lined down to get every ounce of
speed out of it, too,” said Tim. “It cost plenty
of shekels to build that flying boat.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Inside the commodious cabin men were
preparing to get out through the hatch at the rear.
The first to appear was short, squat, with a nose
that looked like a substantial fist had pushed it
back against his face.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Nice looking customer to meet on a dark
night,” said Hunter.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim recognized the second man to appear
as Sladek. He looked to be about 40 with a
strong, hard face and eyes set so far back that
they had a peculiar penetrating intentness and
gave you the idea that Sladek was trying to
ferret out your innermost secrets. The owner of
the amphib was followed by a third man, who
appeared to be a second-rate fighter, while the
pilot was the last to emerge.</p>

<p class='c007' >Hunter stepped forward and spoke to the
former rum runner.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll have your ship refueled and ready
to go in fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thanks. I’ve got to look at some maps.
We’ll be here half an hour at least; perhaps
longer.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim remained in the background. He’d pick
up as much as he could from the conversation of
the visitors before stepping in and asking for a
story. It was evident that the two with Sladek
and the pilot were bodyguards, for they kept
close to their employer and scanned everyone
with suspicious eyes.</p>

<p class='c007' >Sladek went into the administration building
and scanned the large scale map of the state
which hung on one wall. Tim, loitering behind,
started involuntarily as he saw the section of
the state which interested Sladek. It was the
Cedar river country—the same section into
which his mysterious “Mr. Seven” had gone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch7' class='c005'>CHAPTER SEVEN<br /> <br />On the Trail of “Mr. Seven”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >The field manager, who had been
supervising the refueling of the amphibian,
came into the office and Sladek turned toward
him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What do you know about the Cedar river
country?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s bad business for flyers,” replied Hunter.
“The entire valley is wooded, with many high
bluffs, and if your motor goes bad there isn’t a
safe place to set down. All you can do is aim at
some tree top and hope for the best.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s one reason I flew out here in an
amphib. There shouldn’t be much trouble landing
on the river.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not unless you smack down and ram a
sand bar or have a snag come up and smash in
the bottom of your ship.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s encouraging. Doesn’t look like we
could go much further tonight. You’d better
roll my ship into one of the hangars. We’ll
want to get an early start in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“If there’s some particular place you want
to know about in the valley, Tim Murphy may
be able to help you,” suggested Hunter.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Who’s Tim Murphy?” demanded Sladek.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s the flying reporter for the Atkinson
<i>News</i>. He’s flown all over that country and
with the exception of a small field near the
village of Auburn there isn’t another place to land
safely and then a big ship like yours couldn’t
make it.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You can leave reporters out of this,”
snapped Sladek. “I guess I’ll be able to get along
all right.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim, standing behind him, grinned. He was
certain that “Mr. Seven” and Jack Sladek were
bound for the valley of the Cedar on the same
mission. Neither one wanted publicity.</p>

<p class='c007' >Sladek, his two bodyguards and his pilot,
left the airport in a taxicab. After the amphib
had been rolled into a hangar and berthed for
the night, Hunter turned to Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What do you make of him?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s after something big,” said the flying
reporter, “or he wouldn’t have flown out here.
Another thing, he doesn’t want any publicity
on his arrival. All of which makes me sure that
there is a big story over in the valley of the
Cedar.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That means you’ll be heading that way
tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Maybe before that.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Trying to land there in the dark would be
suicide.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t think a plane will do a whole lot of
good on a story like this. I’ve a hunch that a
car and a good pair of legs may be best.”</p>

<p class='c007' >It was eight-thirty when Tim returned to
the office to plunge again into the files in quest
of the identity of “Mr. Seven.” A scrub
woman at the other end of the office looked at him
curiously, then went about her work. There
was no explaining the action of these
newspaper men who came and went at all hours of
the night.</p>

<p class='c007' >The day by day record of events slipped
through Tim’s fingers as he went through the
file with new enthusiasm. Six months, then nine
months and finally a year of action passed. A
clock outside boomed eleven but still there was
no clue to “Mr. Seven.” Tim went to the
library for a new supply of files and spread them
out on his own desk and Ralph’s. His eyes were
getting heavy but he kept at the task.</p>

<p class='c007' >Footsteps sounded on the stairs and he
looked up to see the managing editor appear in
the doorway.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s up, Tim?” asked Carson.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Just trailing a story,” replied the flying
reporter, “and right now it looks like a mighty
slim trail with the scent growing fainter every
minute.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Let’s hear about it.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim recounted briefly the arrival of “Mr.
Seven” and how he had aroused the interest of
the flying reporter. Then he told of the arrival
of Jack Sladek and linked the two together.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’re after something in the Cedar river
valley and if I could only get the key to the
identity of ‘Mr. Seven’ I might know what to
aim at.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The possibilities of the story caught the
managing editor’s vivid imagination.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll give you a hand,” he said, “you scan the
pages on the right; I’ll take the ones on the left.
You’ve given me enough description so I ought
to be able to recognize your man.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Editor and reporter sat down and took up
the task together. Another half hour slipped by
when Tim stopped suddenly. He looked at the
page before him with almost unbelieving eyes.
There, staring at him from the middle of a large
feature, was the likeness of “Mr. Seven.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Have you found him?” asked Carson.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes,” said Tim, but the word was
automatic. He was reading the caption over the
picture and the words, “Grenville Ford,
Adventurer and Globe Trotter,” burned their way
into his mind. This then, was “Mr. G.
Seven.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Why that’s Ford, the globe trotter. He was
with Byrd at the South Pole and with
Adamson when he made his round the world flight
two years ago.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m positive that the man I know as ‘Mr.
Seven’ is Ford,” said Tim. “The likeness is
unmistakable and you must remember that I
have seen ‘Mr. Seven’ at close range a number
of times.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Has anyone else seen him?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Both Dan Watkins and Ralph,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then get them on the phone and have them
come to the office right away.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ralph, roused from a sound sleep, promised
to come at once as did the head of the copydesk.
Tim heard an exclamation from the managing
editor as he replaced the receiver on its hook.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve found the key to the presence of both
Ford and Sladek in the middle west,” he said.
“Listen to this:</p>

<p class='c008' >“NEW YORK CITY—(Special to
the Atkinson <i>News</i>)—Adventure is again
calling Grenville Ford, world famous
adventurer and globe trotter. This time it is
the sunken millions in the stone box of the
tramp steamer, Southern Queen, which
went down in the Caribbean in the fall of
1923. The exact location of the sinking of
the Southern Queen has never been
known but Ford is believed to have
learned the whereabouts of the wreckage
and to be making plans for the salvage of
the sunken treasure.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But just how does that link up with his
visit to Atkinson under an assumed name and
the arrival tonight of Jack Sladek with a couple
of bodyguards?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Wait until I’m through. Then you’ll feel
the same way I do,” insisted the managing
editor. He continued reading from the story in
the files:</p>

<p class='c008' >“When the revolution headed by
Manuel Crespes in Guato failed, Crespes
and his fellow adventurers looted the rich
mines there and fled aboard the <i>Southern
Queen</i>. Estimates at the amount of gold
taken by the fleeing rebels have varied
from $500,000 to more than $5,000,000
but it is safe to say that sufficient gold was
taken to make an attempt at its recovery
highly worthwhile.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The <i>Southern Queen</i> left Martee, the
main port of Guato, apparently in good
condition but the vessel never reached
port. Exactly what happened has never
been known. Her disappearance has been
one of the mysteries of the seven seas.
Various theories have been advanced.
One of the most persistent was that the
leaders of the futile revolution in Guato
killed all members of the crew when they
neared a safe coast, scuttled the ship, took
the treasure and escaped in small boats.
Another is that a storm which raged in
the Caribbean shortly after the <i>Southern
Queen</i> left Martee caught the little tramp
steamer in its center and sent it whirling
to the bottom with the loss of everyone
on board. Several expeditions have been
formed to hunt for the treasure but none
of them have been successful and so far no
actual trace of the <i>Southern Queen</i> has
been found.</p>

<p class='c010' >“<i>News</i> that Ford is planning to search
for the treasure brings the story into the
forefront again for he is known as a
soldier of fortune of the higher type. While
Ford refuses to divulge his plans in any
detail, friends believe that he has learned
the whereabouts of one of the survivors
of the <i>Southern Queen</i>”</p>

<p class='c009' >The story went on to recount other
adventures in which Ford had played a prominent
part but added nothing more in the way of
information about the hunt for the treasure of
the Southern Queen.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m still trying to guess what brought him
out here,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s as plain as though written on the wall,”
replied the managing editor. “This story was
printed more than a year ago, yet Ford hasn’t
started his expedition. Money hasn’t held him
up for he has plenty to finance any such trip.
What did? Something must have happened to
his source of information. Either it vanished or
he has had to do far more work in ferreting out
the facts than he expected. In either case I’m
betting that Ford came here under an assumed
name and went into the Cedar river valley for
the one and only purpose of learning
something which is vital to the success of his
treasure hunt.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“If he is seeking information in connection
with the treasure of the <i>Southern Queen</i> that
would explain his use of an assumed name and
his evasion of reporters,” agreed Tim. “It
would also account for the presence of Sladek,
who tries to vote himself into anything that
looks like easy money.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“In other words both Ford and Sladek are
after the sunken treasure in the <i>Southern
Queen</i> and there’s some information over in
the valley of the Cedar that both are after,”
said Carson.</p>

<p class='c007' >“All of which may mean a good story for the
<i>News</i>” smiled Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“When can you start for the valley?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Right away.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Can you go by plane?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not tonight. I’ll drive down. Ralph can
bring the plane in tomorrow and land near
Auburn. I’m not sure a plane will be much use
except for a fast trip home with the story. I’ll
probably have to take a boat if I want to get
around much in that country.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Got any cash?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Less than $10.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Carson dug into his own pocket. “Here’s
$20. I’ll have Ralph bring you expense money
when he flies over.”</p>

<p class='c007' >In their eager discussion of the possibilities
of the story they had almost forgotten the
telephone calls to Ralph and Dan Watkins and
Tim was about to depart for the Cedar river
valley when they burst into the office.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s the matter?” asked Watkins.
“Something big break?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not yet, but soon,” grinned Tim. “We
think we’ve learned the identity of ‘Mr. Seven.’
Both you and Ralph have seen him. Take a
good look at that picture over there and tell us
what you think.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The newcomers scanned the printed
likeness of Grenville Ford with critical eyes.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s ‘Mr. Seven’ without a doubt,” said
the chief copyreader and Ralph added his
agreement.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then you’d better start for the valley at
once,” said Carson.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You might tell us a little about it,”
suggested the veteran head of the copy desk.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ll hear full details when the story
breaks,” cried Tim as he headed for the stairs.</p>

<p class='c007' >He took the best of the cars which the <i>News</i>
owned for the trip, a powerful coupe capable
of high speed and standing lots of abuse on the
rough roads of the Cedar valley.</p>

<p class='c007' >He swung in front of the <i>News</i> building,
just as the others came down from the editorial
office.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll take you home,” he called.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve got my car,” replied the managing
editor.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The short walk will do me good,” added
Watkins, but Ralph decided to ride.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Carson told us the whole story and says
I’m to fly over in the morning and land near
Auburn,” he said. “Will you be there?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s hard to say, but if I’m not you wait
for me even if you have to stay there a couple
of days.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sounds like a vacation trip.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It may be anything but that.” Then,
thinking of the big amphibian and Jack Sladek and
his bodyguards, he added: “The amphibian
Sladek came in is in the hangar next to the one
we use. If I leave you at the field, do you
suppose you could fix it so they’d be delayed
several hours getting their motor started in the
morning?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s as good as done,” said Ralph. “With
this flight on tomorrow I’ll have an excuse to
visit the field.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim left Ralph at the airport and sped on
alone toward the valley of the mighty Cedar.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch8' class='c005'>CHAPTER EIGHT<br /> <br />A Sudden Attack</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >For the first fifty miles of the trip the
roads were hard-surfaced and Tim sped
along at a fast pace, the long, powerful coupe
eating up the miles. But after that it was harder
going. The roads were poorly marked and
badly rutted. Tim was forced to drive well
under thirty miles an hour and as he neared
the valley the country grew more rugged, the
road turning and twisting, climbing laboriously
up one hill and then skidding down another.</p>

<p class='c007' >He lost almost half an hour when he ran into
a local shower and had to get out and put on
the chains. Once or twice the big coupe
skidded badly but he managed to hold it on to the
road. At dawn he was deep into the valley of
the Cedar, the narrow road was dry again, and
he took off the chains.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was no bridge across the Cedar at
Auburn and Tim pulled the coupe up on the left
bank of the river and waited for the arrival of
the ramshackle ferry.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was seven o’clock before the old barge,
powered by an automobile engine, paddled its
way across the broad stream and nosed up to
the landing stage.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How much to go across?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Dollar for a car that size,” replied the
riverman.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim handed over the fee and drove the
coupe aboard. The engine of the ferry
sputtered and then settled down to its task as the
paddles flashed in the morning sunlight.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Business been pretty good?” Tim asked.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Only fair. Usually don’t get anyone on the
morning trip but yesterday I had a car almost
as large as yours.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Here was what Tim had been fishing for.
He was on the right trail and a few more
questions assured him that Grenville Ford had
driven directly to Auburn after leaving
Atkinson.</p>

<p class='c007' >When the ferry docked on the Auburn side,
Tim went to the general store. He was known
there for, two years before, he had helped save
the village, marooned by a flood, by bringing
food and needed medicine. At the store he
learned that Ford had stored his car in the
village, rented a boat with an outboard motor,
laid in a supply of food and a tent, and started
down river the day before.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Have any idea where he was going?” asked
Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He didn’t seem to want to say much about
himself,” said the storekeeper. “Appeared to be
one of those close-mouthed fellows.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim went across the street to the village’s
one hotel and there obtained an excellent
breakfast. Greatly refreshed, he went down to the
river bank to make more inquiries. In front of
one shanty was the sign, “BOATS FOR
RENT,” and to this place Tim went at once.</p>

<p class='c007' >The owner was a white-haired riverman and
when Tim introduced himself, he found the
boatman willing to talk.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I remember the fellow well,” said the
riverman, “but he didn’t say where he was going.
Just asked to rent a boat for about a week and
he left a cash deposit, which is all I require,
seemed to know what he wanted for he picked
out a good boat and started down river at
once.”</p>

<p class='c007' >There was little to be learned in that
information and Tim tried another tack.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Any strangers moved into the valley in the
last year or two?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007' >The old man shook his head. “All the movin’
that’s done is the other way. Keeps up much
longer and there won’t be anybody in the
valley and no Indians to give it back to.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I just though there might have been some
new people came in—maybe a sailor or two.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Nothin’ to sail around here except the
clammers and they don’t sail. Only man around
here that’s ever seen big water is Crazy John
Boggs.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Who’s Crazy John?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He came in here about nine or ten years ago
and went down river to an island where he
does a little clammin’ and pearl huntin’. He’s
always talking about revolutions and sunken
treasure and such as that. He’s as crazy as they
make them.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Such talk might sound crazy to the people
of the valley but to Tim it was another link in
his story.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How far down river is it to Crazy John’s?”
asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“About thirty miles and bad water all the
way. He’s way off the main channel and he
don’t like company. Keeps a couple of regular
man-eating dogs. Some folks say he’s got mines
planted all around the island so he can blow up
anyone he doesn’t want around. No one from
here’s ever been on the place.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Here’s one that’s going,” said Tim. “Fix
me out with a boat and an outboard. I’ll
be back as soon as I can get some grub at the
store.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim felt jubilant as he walked up from the
river bank. Ford, or “Mr. Seven,” was only
twenty-four hours ahead of him.</p>

<p class='c007' >The sound of an airplane motor drummed
over the village and Tim looked up to see the
Jupiter swinging around to land in the only
field that could be used. It was a mile outside
the village and he knew he would have plenty
of time to secure his food and a couple of
blankets before Ralph arrived.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Fix me up with enough food for about four
days on the river,” Tim told the storekeeper,
“and I’ll want a couple of good, warm blankets.
I expect the nights in the valley are a little
chilly.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’re all of that,” agreed the
storekeeper. When the food and blankets were
ready, Tim paid the bill and left the store. At
the far end of the street Ralph was hurrying
in to town and Tim waited for him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Starting out as a peddler?” asked the
newcomer.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Just getting ready to start down river.
Come on and help me stow this stuff away.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The riverman had a sixteen foot
flat-bottomed boat ready for Tim. A light
outboard had been fastened to the stern and an
extra can of gasoline had been placed in the
boat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s the idea of the river trip?” Ralph
wanted to know. Tim related what he had
learned in the village and Ralph nodded his
agreement to the plans.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You stay here and keep the Jupiter ready
to fly any minute,” said Tim. “When I get
back I’ll want to start for Atkinson as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Everything will be ready. Here’s the extra
expense money Carson sent for you.” Ralph
handed out $50 and Tim paid the deposit
necessary for the boat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“There may be some fellows in here a little
later in another airplane,” he told the
riverman. “They’re apt to inquire about Crazy
John. Do you suppose you could forget all
about him?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“After what you did for us when we had
the flood I could forget a whole lot,” smiled
the owner of the boats.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sladek and his men won’t be here for a
couple more hours,” chuckled Ralph. “What
I didn’t do to their motors last night doesn’t
amount to much. I had a hard time to keep
from laughing this morning. Poor old Carl
at the airport was the goat. They accused him
of failing to keep a proper watch over their
plane. We’ll have to square it with him some
way.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim obtained detailed instructions from the
boatman on the way to Crazy John’s island.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Don’t try to sneak up,” was the riverman’s
final word of caution, “or he’ll get you sure.
Just keep off shore in plain sight and do some
lusty hollerin’.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim thanked him for the final words of
advice, said goodbye to Ralph and started to shove
off when his friend stopped him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Got a gun?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim shook his head. “I won’t need one. I
don’t think Crazy John is as bad as he’s pictured
and I’m sure I won’t have any trouble with
Ford.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“But there’s Sladek and his bodyguards. If
you run into them, you might get in a jam.
Better take this.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ralph handed Tim a heavy, snub-nosed
automatic.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s loaded and here’s two extra clips. Take
care of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“See you in a day or two,” said Tim as he
shoved away from the landing stage. Turning
on the ignition he gave the starter rope on the
outboard a jerk. The motor responded with
a steady putt-putt-putt and Tim started the
journey down stream to the island abode of
Crazy John.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ralph watched the boat until it was lost
from view behind a curve in the broad river.
Then he turned and went back to the village,
had breakfast, obtained gasoline, and walked
back to the Jupiter where he replenished the
fuel and sat down in the shade. He was going to
have lots of nothing to do until Tim returned.</p>

<p class='c007' >On the Cedar, Tim’s small craft surged
steadily down-river. There was no regular
navigation on the stream and the channel
swung from one side to another.</p>

<p class='c007' >Black snags stuck their dangerous heads
above the surface of the water and occasionally
a broad sand bar ran almost across the stream.
Finding the channel was no easy task and Tim
realized that it might be at least two days under
the best of circumstances before he returned to
the village.</p>

<p class='c007' >The Cedar turned and twisted, first on one
side of the heavily wooded valley and then on
another. Bayous opened off on long, quiet
stretches of back water and once in a while
he could see the mouth of some tributary
sneaking in around a bluff.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was no sign of human habitation and
he felt immensely lonely. He might have been
the first white man down the stream and he
would not have been surprised to have rounded
a curve and sighted an Indian village on the
next strip of sand.</p>

<p class='c007' >The day was warm and if his mission had
not been so urgent, he would have fully
enjoyed the trip. But there was a tension that
gripped him and drove him on at full speed.
He wanted to be at Crazy John’s well before
sundown.</p>

<p class='c007' >At noon Tim estimated that he was
two-thirds of the way to his destination. Slowing
down the motor, he dug into his provisions
and managed a snack of lunch. He drank deeply
from a jug of cool water the riverman had
placed in the boat and felt greatly refreshed.
The strain of a night without sleep and the
hard drive from Atkinson was beginning to
tell on him.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim wondered when the amphibian would
soar overhead. Ralph certainly had done an
excellent job in putting the big craft out of
commission.</p>

<p class='c007' >Another hour slipped by. He was nearing
the bayou where he would turn away from the
main river and seek out the island of Crazy
John. The boatman had told him to look for
an island with a monster cottonwood, split by
a bolt of lightning. When he came to that island
he was to take the bayou to the right and
continue taking every possible turn to the right.
Crazy John’s island was a third of a mile from
the main stream. Tim remembered the
warning to shout lustily at intervals after he left the
main channel.</p>

<p class='c007' >His sturdy little craft swung around a broad
curve, dodged the end of a projecting sand bar,
slid between two snags, and straightened out
down stream again. Tim’s heart leaped.</p>

<p class='c007' >A half mile down river, standing on an
island in the center of the stream, was a giant
cottonwood, its top split asunder by lightning.
The huge tree towered above everything else
in the valley. There was no mistaking it and
Tim looked for a bayou to the right of the
island.</p>

<p class='c007' >From behind him and sounding above the
steady throbbing of the outboard came the
thrumming of airplane engines. Tim glanced
back. The amphibian, flying fast and low, was
coming down stream.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim wondered if the pilot of the big ship
would try to land on the river. The Cedar was
wide enough but the danger of snags was a
very real one. A sunken log could rip out the
bottom of the plane and pull the entire craft to
the bottom of the river.</p>

<p class='c007' >Fascinated by the beauty of the big
amphibian, Tim watched it approach. The roar of the
motors filled the valley with their noise. The
craft was less than a hundred feet above the
river and coming directly toward Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >Looking up, the reporter could see a man
leaning from a window on the right side of
the cabin. There was something black in his
hand. Splashes of water appeared beside the
boat. The seat beside Tim splintered under the
impact of a bullet. Then the amphibian was
roaring down stream.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim was cold with anger. The attack on him
had been wanton. There was only one
explanation. They had taken him for Grenville Ford.
The sooner he could get away from the open
reaches of the river the safer.</p>

<p class='c007' >He jammed the throttle of the outboard on
full and his boat leaped ahead. Risking a sand
bar, Tim cut the comers close and before the
amphibian could swing back upstream he was
safely hidden under the shelter of heavy foliage
from the bank.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch9' class='c005'>CHAPTER NINE<br /> <br />In the Valley</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >From his temporary place of refuge Tim
watched the amphibian circle over the
valley. They were hunting for his hiding place
and he pulled his boat in closer to shore where
the dense foliage would effectually screen him
from the eyes of the observers above.</p>

<p class='c007' >For fifteen minutes the big plane soared
overhead. Then as quickly as it had come it
vanished upstream and Tim guessed that it was
going to Auburn to learn exact directions for
reaching the island of Crazy John.</p>

<p class='c007' >Once sure that he was safe from the
amphibian for the time being, Tim started his engine
and chugged away from his refuge. The water
of the bayou into which he turned was quiet,
but there was the hidden menace of snags and
Tim was compelled to move forward slowly.</p>

<p class='c007' >Another bayou opened off the first and then
another. At each one Tim directed his boat
toward the right and each time he stood up and
shouted lustily. There was no response.</p>

<p class='c007' >The water was shallow now; not more than
two feet deep. Rank water grasses waved above
the surface but through them there was a
definite watercourse and Tim followed this,
stopping from time to time to repeat his shouts.</p>

<p class='c007' >Nosing through a thick clump of the water
grass, he came into a stretch of open water at
the far end of which was a ramshackle dock.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim shut off his outboard, lifted the motor
into his boat, and set his oars into their sockets.
With steady strokes he pulled toward the
island. A hundred yards from the dock he let his
oars drag, turned toward the island, cupped his
hands, and shouted mightily.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hello, there on the island,” he cried.
“Hello! hello!”</p>

<p class='c007' >But the only response was the mocking
echoes. Tim waited a full minute; then
proceeded slowly toward the dock. Once more
he rested on the oars and called. This time the
baying of dogs answered and two huge beasts
came galloping down to the water’s edge.
Teeth bared, they waited for him to come
ashore.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim had no intention of providing a meal
for the dogs, and he kept a safe distance from
shore. For five minutes the dogs snapped and
snarled at him. Then they were silent and two
men appeared from the tangle of brush.</p>

<p class='c007' >Grenville Ford was in the lead with an older
man, greatly stooped, behind him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What do you want?” called Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m Tim Murphy of the Atkinson <i>News</i>.
Let me come ashore.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Nobody lands here, mate,” boomed the
man behind Ford, and Tim was surprised at
the vigor of the tone. Crazy John, from his
voice, was anything but a weakling despite the
stoop in his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What was all the shooting a few minutes
ago?” asked Ford cautiously.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Fellow by the name of Jack Sladek who
landed at Atkinson last night was flying over
the river in an amphibian,” replied Tim. “He
took a few shots at me and I’ve an idea he
thought he was shooting at you.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He probably did,” agreed Ford. “Well,
since you’ve come this far you might as well
come ashore. I see you discovered that ‘Mr.
Seven’ was just an assumed name.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I didn’t find out until last night and then
with the coming of Sladek, things commenced
to click. You know what I’m after.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ford nodded. “You want a story about my
plans to hunt for the treasure in the <i>Southern
Queen</i>?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Right. The fact that both you and Sladek
are here in this valley is enough to make a
rattling good story. I’d rather have facts but
if I can’t get them I’ll have to do a little guess
work and I’ve a hunch I can come pretty close
at that. Crazy John came to the valley nine or
ten years ago and the Southern Queen
disappeared eleven years ago.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“And you think Crazy John knows where
the Queen sunk and that both Sladek and
myself are after the information?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Right again.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ford laughed. “I’ll confess I admire your
nerve. Of course you knew the reputation
Crazy John has for shooting anyone who
prowls around his island.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I knew that,” grinned Tim, “but I hadn’t
figured on being shot at from an airplane. That
was a little uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Pull your boat in,” said Ford. Then,
turning to the former sailor, he added. “It’s all right,
John. This young man is a friend of mine. We
may need his help before the night is over.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim made his boat fast at the dock and
followed Ford and Crazy John up a twisting path.
The dogs, mongrel hounds, trailed behind
them. On a slight elevation in the middle of
the island was Crazy John’s house, a rambling
structure of logs and timber that had been
salvaged from the river. Vines softened the
bareness of the house. Inside it was livable, the
floor of hard beaten clay swept clean, with a
huge fireplace taking one whole wall. On the
opposite side opened two cubicles which were
used for sleeping quarters.</p>

<p class='c007' >Crazy John puffed slowly at his pipe.
“They don’t lose much time,” he said as the
sound of an airplane came faintly over the
bayou.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sladek’s a fast worker,” conceded Ford.
“I hardly believed he would be able to follow
me here. If he finds you, he’ll do anything to
get the secret of the Southern Queen.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He won’t find me,” said Crazy John.
“There’s half a hundred places I can hide in
the valley.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The sound of the airplane was nearer and
they stepped out of the cabin. The amphibian
was in sight but low and on the other side of
the valley.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s going to land.” said Tim. “There’s a
long stretch of clear water over there.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’ll never be able to taxi that big flying
boat up this bayou,” added Ford. “It will be
an hour before they can get here. Did Sladek
have his usual gunmen with him?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Two beside the pilot,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m not afraid of a fight,” went on Ford,
“but there is no use in getting into trouble if it
can be avoided. We’ll leave the island at once
and John can find one of the refuges he speaks
about.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good idea,” said the old sailor. “I’ll tell
you how to find another way out of the
bayou.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Crazy John went into the cabin to pick up a
few belongings he wanted to take and Tim had
a chance to speak to Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Do I get the story?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If we get out of this all right, I’ll do the
best I can,” promised Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim had to be satisfied with that, for it was
imperative that they get away from the island.</p>

<p class='c007' >Crazy John reappeared, this time with a
duffle bag, and he set off down the path ahead
of them. He tossed his bag in Tim’s boat and
climbed in.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Where’s your boat?” Tim asked Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s half way around the island. We’ll pick
it up on our way out.”</p>

<p class='c007' >With experienced hands, the old sailor
started the outboard and they shot out into the
shallow bayou. With a skill born of long
acquaintance with the river, Crazy John guided
the boat between snags and always found safe
water. They nosed into a cove and picked up
Ford’s boat, which they took in tow.</p>

<p class='c007' >From the river itself they could hear the
thunder of the motors of the amphibian as the
pilot taxied it up and down stream hunting
for the opening of the bayou which led to
Crazy John’s island.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good thing they’re not in the air. They’d
spot us in a minute,” said Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We could get under cover in a minute,”
said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You mean we might be able to,” Ford’s
finger touched the splintered seat at the rear
of the boat. “Next time they might not miss.”
Crazy John shut off the motor and the boat
drifted toward a sand pit. It grated gently on
the bottom and came to rest.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m getting out here,” said the old sailor.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re sure you’ve got everything you
need?” The question was directed to Ford and
Tim caught the intentness with which Crazy
John spoke.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Everything,” said Ford. “Sure you won’t
change your mind?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Crazy John’s face took on a stony look and
his eyes wandered over the valley.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I won’t change,” he said. “This is my home.
I’m satisfied. That gold is cursed. You’ll be
lucky to get back alive.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll get back all right,” promised Ford, “and
you’ll get your share.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ll need good men. Better take this lad.
He’s the kind you can trust.” Crazy John
extended his hand to Ford, then swung his bag
over his shoulder and stalked off along the
sand bar. Soon he was lost in the undergrowth.</p>

<p class='c007' >When Ford turned around, Tim caught a
gleam of moisture in his eyes and his hands
trembled a little.</p>

<p class='c007' >The flying reporter bent down and started
the outboard. The shadows were lengthening
and they must find a safe haven for the night.</p>

<p class='c007' >For an hour they followed the directions
Crazy John had given them, keeping always in
the backwater of the great river. Then they
nosed out toward the main channel. The sound
of the motors of the amphibian had long since
been lost and twilight was enfolding the valley.</p>

<p class='c007' >The globe trotter came back and sat in the
seat just ahead, facing Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’d better hunt a camp site,” he said.
“It’s impossible to make Auburn tonight.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve got plenty of food and blankets,” said
Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“There’s a supply in my boat, too,” nodded
Ford. “Let’s turn off the main river now.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim sent the boat twisting around the sand
bars and toward the mouth of a stream on the
right bank. Trees met above the smaller stream
and 200 yards up its valley they found a small
clearing richly carpeted with grass.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This is fine,” said Ford. “We ought to find
a spring somewhere in the bluffs back of us.”</p>

<p class='c007' >While Tim made the boats fast and unloaded
the duffle, Ford took a water jug and went in
search of water. By the time he was back, Tim
had a fire, built from dry, smokeless wood,
burning well. Supper was not long, with two
experts in camping lending a hand.</p>

<p class='c007' >The meal was simple—bacon, eggs, fried
potatoes, bread and jam, but there was plenty
of everything.</p>

<p class='c007' >After they had eaten their fill, they spread
their blankets beside the fire. It was a time
when men’s tongues are loosened and Tim
waited patiently. He felt that in good time,
Ford would tell him the story of his efforts to
learn the whereabouts of the Southern Queen
and the treasure in gold which it held.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How much do you know about my plans
to recover the gold in the Southern Queen?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c007' >“To be frank, I don’t know a great deal,”
admitted Tim. “When you came to Atkinson
as 'Mr. G. Seven’ you aroused my curiosity. I
knew that somewhere I had seen your picture,
that your name should be on the tip of my
tongue. I’d have learned your identity sooner
but the paper was sponsoring an air circus and
I had to handle the publicity. Then when I
found your picture in the file in a story a little
over a year ago I knew what you were after,
but by that time you had left Atkinson.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“How did you trace me here?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Found out where you had rented your car,
and learned that you had made inquiries about
this section of the state. Then when Sladek
arrived in an amphibian and made similar
inquiries I had a hunch something was going to
break. After reaching Auburn it was easy to
learn that the only man on the river who had
been a sailor was Crazy John.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“So you rented a boat and started downstream
after the story and on the way Sladek’s
outfit took a few shots at you?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s about the size of it. Now all I need
to fill out the story is what you’re going to do.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m going after the treasure in the Southern
Queen and I’m going to take you with me,”
said Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re what?” asked Tim incredulously.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m going to take you with me on the hunt
for the treasure in the hold of the Southern
Queen.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim stared, still unbelieving.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Will you go?” Ford was pressing him for
an answer.</p>

<p class='c007' >“But you don’t know much about me.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I know that you’re resourceful and
courageous and that Crazy John said you were a
good man. I’d take Crazy John’s word for it
even if I didn’t know the other things about
you.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then you can count me in right now if it
can be arranged so I can get a leave of absence
from the <i>News</i>.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c005'>CHAPTER TEN<br /> <br />“Mr. Seven’s” Secret</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >Under the flickering firelight in the
camp in the valley of the Cedar,
Grenville Ford unfolded for Tim the story of the
revolt in Guato, the looting of the gold mines
and the flight from Martee in the old tramp
steamer.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I was covering the revolution in Guato at
the time for the old <i>New York Globe</i>,” said
Ford, as he traced the events which had finally
brought him into contact with the flying
reporter of the <i>News</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The revolution was headed by Manuel
Crespes, who was a professional trouble maker.
He got together a band of desperadoes, all of
the riff-raff in Central America, armed them
with modern weapons, and promised them all
of the loot they could get. In less than a month
he had 3,000 of the toughest soldiers you ever
saw with him.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ford puffed slowly on his pipe.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Three thousand men is quite an army for
Central America,” he went on, “and Crespes
knew how to handle them. He kept them well
fed and paid them promptly. We never knew
where the money came from but we had a
hunch Russia was supplying him with funds.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The revolt started at Martee, the main
seaport, and the rebels swept everything before
them and started inland for the capital, Blanco.
They looted every village they went through
and it looked like they were going to win in
a walkaway. But Crespes didn’t know that the
foxy old president of Guato had purchased a
fleet of American bombing planes and had
secured a bunch of former war pilots to fly
them. When the rebels got up in the narrow
passes of the mountains just east of the capital
the bombers dropped down out of the sky.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I was there that day. Those big eagles just
came out of the blue, unloaded their ‘eggs’ and
then soared away for another load. The rebels
were trapped. In ten minutes the backbone of
the revolt was broken and they were fleeing
for the seaport and safety at Martee. I had a
hard time keeping up with them.</p>

<p class='c007' >“On the way to Martee, Crespes and the
other ringleaders cleaned out the gold mines in
the foothills. I don’t know exactly how much,
but it was at least a million. They managed to
get the bullion to Martee and load it on the
only ship in the harbor, the old Southern
Queen.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They got away just before sunset and were
well out to sea when the bombing planes swept
down in search of them. The Southern Queen
was never reported in any port and no member
of its crew was ever heard from. There were
all kinds of stories. Some said the old steamer
had been caught in a tropical gale and gone
down with all hands, others said that Crespes
had managed to blow it up after getting away
with a large share of the gold while some stories
said the Southern Queen was beached on the
coast of Yucatan, the crew fleeing after dividing
the gold.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It was a mystery that intrigued me. I
wanted to know what had happened to the
ship and its crew and I wanted the gold it held.
For years I ran down one rumor after another.
That story last year sent out from New York
was written around one of the rumors, but my
trip to see Crazy John was based on something
more than rumor.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ford paused while Tim threw fresh fuel on
the flames.</p>

<p class='c007' >“A month ago an old sailorman in New
York told me he’d met a fellow years ago who
said he knew what had happened to the
Southern Queen. I got to checking up and the man
he was talking about was John Boggs, the ship’s
carpenter, the man we know as Crazy John.
Again, through sheer coincidence, I learned
from a pearl dealer in New York that he
occasionally bought fresh water pearls from a
man named John Boggs out here in the Cedar
river valley. It didn’t take me long to get on
the job.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Could Crazy John tell you about the
Southern Queen?”</p>

<p class='c007' >The globe trotter smiled. “Crazy John told
me the whole story and I’m so sure he’s told
the truth that I’m going into the Caribbean at
once.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What happened to the Southern Queen?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It struck a reef off an island on the coast
of Yucatan. The accident happened shortly
after midnight. Crazy John says they started to
sink at once and the crew and rebels were too
drunk to get the boats off. A few jumped
overboard and tried to swim to the island. The
sharks got them. Crazy John managed to get a
skiff launched and he reached the island. It
was uninhabited and a gale wrecked his small
boat. He finally made a raft but he drifted for
days before he was able to get across the
channel to the mainland for the currents held him
just away from the shore. He thinks he went
insane then and it wasn’t until he got away from
the sea and settled down here that his mind
cleared up. But the horror of those days on
the raft is too much for him. He won’t go
back.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t blame him,” said Tim. “It must have
been horrible, drifting for days with the shore
in sight.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve made an agreement with Crazy John
that he is to have a fourth of the treasure if it is
found,” went on Ford. “In turn he has given
me an excellent description of the island and
that section of the coast of Yucatan. I’m
sure I’ll be able to find the island without
difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“But will you be able to locate the remains
of the Southern Queen and bring up the
treasure if you do find her?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s something I’ve got to take a chance
on. A good many people would like to have the
same information I obtained from Crazy
John.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Including Jack Sladek?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Right. Sladek would give a good many
thousand.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Why is he so interested?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sladek was one of the soldiers of fortune
with Crespes on the short-lived revolution. He
had a broken leg and they sailed away from
Martee and left him stranded there. It saved
Sladek’s life, but he doesn’t know that.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“How could he have learned about Crazy
John?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Only through keeping close track of my
movements and I’ve felt for months that
someone has been shadowing me. Sladek is a cool
hand and without scruples but I know the only
way he learned about Crazy John was through
tracing me.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then it looks like he may vote himself a
hand in hunting for the treasure.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He may, but I think I’ll be ready and
capable of taking care of him when the time comes.
Sladek is looked upon none too favorably in
Central America while I believe I can still claim
a lot of friends.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Were you really serious about taking me
on the expedition?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Dead serious,” replied the globe trotter.
“You’re resourceful and that’s exactly the type
I need. Do you think you can arrange with
your editor to get away for about three
months?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“If there’ll be some good stories in
connection with the trip, he won’t be likely
to object.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I guess I can promise him plenty of stories
and some of them may be real thrillers. We’re
going to make the trip in a submarine.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim stared across the flames at Ford,
wondering if he had heard correctly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c005'>CHAPTER ELEVEN<br /> <br />Rescue from the Air</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >In quick phrases and with vivid
description Grenville Ford sketched for him his
plan to search for the treasure in the Southern
Queen.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Crazy John thinks the old ship went down
in about two hundred feet of water; just ripped
its bottom out on the reef, rolled off and
dropped into a deep hole beside the reef. Diving
conditions may be bad so I’m going to take a
submarine. There will be a special diving
compartment so the sub can be taken down to the
bottom beside the Southern Queen and the
divers can walk right out and hunt for the
gold.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Where can you get a submarine?” asked
Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s not difficult,” smiled Ford. “The
government had to decommission two big ones
this summer on account of the last London
naval treaty. I took an option on one of them
and as soon as I can get to a telegraph office
I’m going to buy it. As soon as it is refitted and
I can get a trustworthy crew together I’ll start
for the coast of Yucatan.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Will one of those old government
submarines be safe?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“The type being decommissioned is one of
the finest ever built; sturdy, lots of room for a
submarine, and capable of descending to about
two hundred forty feet without too much
danger. Oh, you’ll get plenty of material for stories
that should please your editor.”</p>

<p class='c007' >They talked at length of plans for the trip,
but finally fatigue closed their lips and they
rolled into their blankets.</p>

<p class='c007' >They were up at dawn, breakfasted quickly,
and started upstream for Auburn.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’re likely to have a little trouble with
Sladek and his crowd before we get out of the
valley,” said Ford. “When he is unable to find
Crazy John he’ll start trailing me.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“When we reach Auburn we’ll be safe. The
Jupiter is faster than Sladek’s amphibian.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“If he overtakes us before we reach the
village, we’ll be in for it.”</p>

<p class='c007' >They chugged steadily up the broad Cedar,
the other boat in tow behind them.</p>

<p class='c007' >Less than five miles below the village the
sound of the amphibian’s engines echoed over
the valley and they turned to see the big ship
winging swiftly toward them.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Here comes trouble,” cried Ford. “We’d
better hit for a bayou where we can find some
shelter.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim opened the throttle of the outboard
wide and swung the nose of the boat sharply to
the left. The amphibian was coming fast. It was
going to be close. Little spurts of water rose
near them. Sladek or someone else on the plane
was shooting at them.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Duck!” shouted Ford as the plane roared
over them.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That was close,” said Tim, pointing to the
bottom of the boat where water was spurting
through a half dozen holes.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Get under the shelter of the trees. We’ll
exchange boats.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim shut off the outboard and they drifted
under the dense foliage of the river bank. They
pulled the other boat alongside and jumped
into it. Tim glanced in the gas tank. There was
plenty of fuel to finish the run to Auburn.</p>

<p class='c007' >The amphibian was circling overhead,
hunting for the prey which now was sheltered by
the trees.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’ll we do, wait here or try to slip along
the bank?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Waiting here won’t do much good. We’ll
nose along shore and see if we can’t give them
the slip.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim snapped the rope on the outboard and
they churned ahead again, keeping as close to
the trees as possible and threading their way
along a bayou which paralleled the river. For
a few minutes they were in comparative safety.
Then an open stretch of the river loomed ahead
and the amphibian swept down on them.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sladek’s going to land on the river,” said
Ford. “We’ll have to duck back into the shelter
of the bayou.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We can switch boats,” suggested Tim. “I’ll
stay in the one with the holes and you may be
able to slip away in this one.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ford shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, hardly. This is my party and I won’t
let you face Sladek and his gang alone.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The amphibian, now a mile up the river, was
settling down to land. The big ship skimmed
the surface of the water, there were sheets of
spray, and it glided swiftly toward them.</p>

<p class='c007' >Above the thrumming of the amphibian’s
motors came a sharper sound and Tim looked
skyward. Then he grabbed Ford’s arm.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Here comes Ralph in the Jupiter. Now
we’ll see some action.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Dropping fast, the cream and green biplane
roared down like an avenging bird. Ralph
levelled off about twenty feet above the river
and sped toward the amphibian. Tim saw
something sticking over the side of the biplane.
It looked like a gun but the distance was too
great and the speed too fast to make sure.</p>

<p class='c007' >The men aboard the amphibian were caught
unawares. The big craft slowed down and
seemed to hesitate as the pilot waited for orders
from Sladek.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ralph whipped the Jupiter over the
amphibian and Tim saw the splatter of shot on the
water. The biplane shot upward and around in
a tight bank and came back at the clumsier
plane, which again was showing signs of life.</p>

<p class='c007' >The motors of the amphibian thundered
mightily. The big ship shook its wings and
lunged ahead, slithers of spray shooting out
from its slide.</p>

<p class='c007' >Overhead hummed the Jupiter and Tim
could see now that Ralph was shooting at the
larger plane. As the amphibian took off, Ralph
circled over them and Tim saw his flying
companion wave.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Ralph will keep Sladek busy for a few
minutes,” he told Ford. “We’d better get to
Auburn as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c007' >While Ralph in the Jupiter chased the slower
amphibian all over the valley, Tim and Ford
sped up the river as fast as the outboard motor
could chug.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That was a timely arrival on the part of
your friend,” grinned Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It wasn’t altogether accidental,” replied
Tim. “I was afraid of trouble and Ralph
remained at Auburn with the ship all tuned up
and ready to go at the slightest hint that I was
in a jam.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He seems to be a mighty good flyer.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s ace high and a fine reporter on top of
that.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then we’d better take him along on the
treasure hunt.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He'd be a fine addition to your crew but
I’m afraid the managing editor will say thumbs
down on that suggestion. One of us has to be
within call. That’s why we seldom have a
vacation together.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I expect you’re right,” said Ford, “but
nevertheless I’d like to have a fellow with his
nerve. I know that Sladek will follow me into
the Caribbean and it’s going to be a fight every
step of the way to find the Southern Queen and
then to get the treasure up. It won’t be safe
until we get back to New York and place it in
bank vaults.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then you expect Sladek to trail you all the
way?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“There’s no question about it. With at least
a cool million in gold at stake, he’ll stop at
nothing to get his hands on it and he seems to have
plenty of money. Then there’s a little personal
bitterness between us that dates clear back to
the trouble in Guato in 1923.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“All of which means a mighty unusual trip,”
added Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >They reached the landing stage at Auburn
without further trouble and Ford explained
briefly that they had had an accident with the
other boat. He gave the boatman directions
where he could find his craft and paid
liberally for the damages.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll hike out to the pasture we use for a
landing field when we stop here,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >Several cows were grazing almost in the
center of the pasture and Tim and Ford ran to
chase them into a far corner as Ralph dropped
down to a fast landing. He killed his speed
quickly, whipped around and rolled the plane
over toward them.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hop in,” he shouted. “I don’t think that
amphib has any love for me.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim and Ford piled into the front cockpit
and Ralph opened the throttle. There was no
wind and he took off straight across the
pasture just as the amphibian roared over Auburn.</p>

<p class='c007' >The Jupiter was a good 40 miles an hour
faster than the big ship and Ralph waved his
fingers derisively at the amphibian as he lined
the biplane away for Auburn.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c005'>CHAPTER TWELVE<br /> <br />Against Time</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >The fleet, powerful Jupiter soon
outdistanced the slower amphibian and with
Ralph at the controls, they sped toward
Atkinson at 150 miles an hour. The roar of the motor
was too loud for conversation and Tim settled
down in the cushioned seat and reviewed the
exciting events of the last 72 hours.</p>

<p class='c007' >They ranged all the way from the thrilling
chase after Ace McDowell to the deadly game
of hide and seek they had just completed with
Jack Sladek and his companions aboard the
amphibian.</p>

<p class='c007' >The big thing now was the fact that he had
been invited to go with Grenville Ford on the
quest for the sunken treasure in the Southern
Queen. Tim, worn by the strain of the last few
hours, closed his eyes as he contemplated the
story possibilities of the treasure hunt.</p>

<p class='c007' >That there would be plenty of adventure
went without saying. From the one encounter
with Sladek he knew that the soldier of fortune
would go to any length to obtain the treasure.</p>

<p class='c007' >The thought of making the trip into the
Caribbean in a submarine appealed strongly to
Tim. What a contrast it would be after his
stirring adventures in the air as the flying
reporter for the <i>News</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim glanced at his companion. Grenville
Ford appeared to be enjoying every minute of
the flight back to Atkinson. There was a
pleasant upturn to his lips and the chin, although
square cut, was kindly. But the cheery light in
Ford’s eyes was what appealed to Tim most
for he felt that one of the best ways to judge a
man’s character was by his eyes. Ford’s were
piercing but they were steady and a perpetual
laugh lurked in their depths. Tim sensed that
he would make an excellent leader, a man in
whom utmost trust could be placed and he
knew he would have no hesitancy in following
Ford on the trip.</p>

<p class='c007' >The Jupiter flashed over the outskirts of
Atkinson and Ralph cut the throttle. They
dropped down to an easy landing and rolled up
on the ramp in front of the hangar.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim, now a trifle stiff from the strenuous
events and the night in the valley of the Cedar,
climbed slowly from the cockpit. Ford
followed.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ralph scrambled out from the rear cockpit
and joined them. He was grinning broadly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Guess I managed to get in for a little of the
fun in the valley,” he chuckled. “When I
dropped down on that amphib the first time I
thought those boys were going to have heart
failure.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What kind of a gun did you have?” asked
Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ralph reached into the cockpit and brought
out an ancient double barreled shotgun.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Here’s the pet. Believe me I’ve got a sore
shoulder. This old blunderbuss bucks like a
Missouri mule.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Do you make a practice of carrying an
arsenal around with you?” asked Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hardly. When I heard the drone of the
amphibian down the river I figured something was
up for I knew you fellows must be on your way
back. I borrowed this relic from the
storekeeper at Auburn and got into the air as soon
as I could.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You were just in time,” said Tim. “The
amphibian was down on the surface of the river
and all set to taxi along and give us a nice,
cheerful little party.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What I want to know now,” put in Ralph,
“is about the story.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim glanced toward Ford. He felt it was up
to the other to say the first word on that
subject.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I think we’d better go uptown and talk
with your managing editor,” said Ford. “He’ll
have to decide just what is to be printed now.
Is that agreeable to everyone?”</p>

<p class='c007' >There were no objections and they left the
Jupiter for a ground crew to roll into the
hangar. Signalling a taxi, they were soon speeding
into the heart of the city.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was ten-thirty. The first mail edition
would be on the press then. Another hour and
the deadline for the noon mail, which also had
a big street sale. They’d have to work fast if
they got the story of Grenville Ford’s plans for
the treasure hunt into the noon edition. It
would depend on how long they talked with
the managing editor. Tim had the facts on his
finger tips. Once at a typewriter he knew
he could spin the story in rapid-fire order.</p>

<p class='c007' >George Carson was in the editorial office
when they entered.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Did you get the story?” he asked Tim
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve got the man,” replied Tim,
introducing Ford. “It’s going to be up to you on how
much of a story develops out of our trip to
Cedar valley.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Come into my office. We’ll discuss it at
once.”</p>

<p class='c007' >In the managing editor’s office Ford sat down
in a chair across the desk from Carson. Tim
and Ralph, more restless and anxious to get at
the actual writing of the story, stood up.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll be brief,” said Ford. “In the first place,
let me say that you have two unusually
resourceful reporters in Murphy and Graves.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“There’s none better,” admitted Carson,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m going on a hunt for the treasure in the
old tramp steamer, Southern Queen,” went on
Ford. “The vessel disappeared eleven years ago
in the Caribbean with an unknown amount of
gold in its hold. I actually don’t know how
much but it is sufficient to make an expensive
expedition in search of the treasure very much
worthwhile and I’m leaving New York as soon
as possible. I want Tim Murphy to go with me.
In return, I’ll give you exclusive rights to the
stories of the treasure hunt. What do you think
about it?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Just this,” snapped Carson. “Tim has a
leave of absence, starting right now, with full
pay to be with you as long as necessary. I want
the first exclusive story on your adventures in
the Cedar river valley.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I was afraid of that,” smiled Ford, “but I
guess that can’t be helped. You see, Jack
Sladek, one of the rebels who looted the gold
mines in Guato, is on the same quest I am. He
almost got Tim and me this morning. If it
hadn’t been for Ralph and a borrowed
double-barreled shotgun we might now be among the
missing.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What a story, what a story!” enthused
Carson. “We won’t need to name Sladek if that
will prove too embarrassing for you. We can
call it a mysterious attack from the air.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I think that would be better,” agreed Ford.
“Sladek has voted himself in this thing to the
finish but now that I know he’s after the gold,
I’ll be on guard and able to take care of myself.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“When will you want Tim to leave?” asked
the managing editor.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll phone for reservations on the late
afternoon plane east,” said Ford. “Is that too soon
for you, Tim?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I can be ready within an hour after I
finish my story,” replied the flying reporter.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then get into the news room and get
busy,” said the managing editor, glancing at the
clock on his desk. “It’s just ten-fifty now. I’ll
instruct the press room that the noon edition
may be down ten minutes late and to get ready
to rush it through. That will give you about
fifty minutes to write your story. Think you
can make it?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll get the most important part done by
then,” promised Tim. “After the noon edition
I can polish up the story and round out the
details.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Go to it. And Ralph, you write a first
person story about your flight this morning. Put
plenty of punch and get the smell of powder
into it. We’re going to have a smash front page
this noon.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Almost forgetting his visitor, Carson hurried
after his reporters, stopping at the city desk
to inform Ed Campbell of the big stories that
were coming up, then dashing back to phone
the press room to be ready for a rush edition.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim stripped off his coat, flung it over the
back of his chair, rolled a sheet of copypaper
into his typewriter, and plunged headlong
into the story. Swiftly, graphically he painted
the picture of the treasure hunt in the
Caribbean with an unknown fortune in gold at
stake, informing the readers of the <i>News</i> that
they would have the first information on the
progress of the expedition.</p>

<p class='c007' >At his desk across the aisle Ralph was beating
a frantic tattoo on his typewriter, describing in
detail how he had routed the “unknown” plane
in the Cedar river valley.</p>

<p class='c007' >Page after page of copy spun from their
machines and was hurried to the copy desk where
Dan Watkins personally supervised the editing
of the story.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Much more to come?” Dan asked Tim. It
was eleven-thirty.</p>

<p class='c007' >“One more page,” replied Tim, without
looking up from his machine.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ralph finished his story with a bang of
typewriter keys and straightened up. It had been
a terrific strain working against time.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim’s fingers still raced as the words of the
story flowed out. The deadline was past, yet
they were holding the presses just for his story.
Everything else was ready. The last of Ralph’s
copy was coming off the linotypes out in the
composing room. Make-up men, stereotypers
and pressmen were all waiting for the final
period on his story. Scores of newsboys were
impatiently banging their heels down in the big
circulation room listening for the roar of the
presses which would signal that the noon
edition was ready.</p>

<p class='c007' >Perspiration stood out in beads on Tim’s
forehead. There was so much to write and yet
so little time in which to do it. He tore off each
paragraph now, speeding it to the waiting
linotypes.</p>

<p class='c007' >Dan Watkins bent over him again.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Only a minute left,” he said softly.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim nodded. He could write another
column. That would have to come later when he
polished up the story for the city edition. In a
last, breathless paragraph he finished his story.</p>

<p class='c007' >The copyreader almost tore it from his hands
and ran toward the composing room. The
story was done. It was eleven forty on the tick.
Tim relaxed in his chair.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ed Campbell stepped over.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Great piece of writing,” said the city
editor. “When do you leave?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“This afternoon on the plane east,” replied
Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll miss you a lot,” went on Campbell,
“but I know you’ll be sending us some swell
yarns.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll do my best,” promised Tim.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c005'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN<br /> <br />Eastward Bound</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >After a hasty lunch Tim and Ralph
returned to the <i>News</i> office to complete
the polishing up of the stories which had
appeared in the noon edition. They expanded on
the details of their adventures in the valley of
the Cedar and by two o’clock Tim was
through. George Carson came out of his office.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Have any idea how long this Caribbean
trip is going to take?” asked the managing
editor.</p>

<p class='c007' >“At least two months; perhaps longer,”
replied Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I expected as much. You’ll be on full time
pay while you’re away and I’ve made
arrangements for the New York Journal’s radio station
to keep in contact with your submarine and
relay your stories on to us. The Journal, in
return, has the exclusive right in New York to
print any of your stuff it desires.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s certainly fair enough and it insures
speedy transmission for my yarns,” nodded
Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve told the cashier to provide you with
an extra $500 to use in case of an emergency
and he’s preparing a letter of credit should it be
needed. That ought to cover any financial
difficulties. Take care of yourself and good luck.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The managing editor shook Tim’s hand and
then turned back to his own office. Other
members of the staff stopped to say goodbye and to
envy him the adventurous trip.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ralph was the last. His eyes were misty as
he grasped Tim’s hands.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I wish I could go along with the Jup. You
may need a little rescuing before this trip is
over.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I wish you could go,” replied Tim, “but
there’ll probably be plenty of excitement
around here while I’m gone and you’ll thrive
on that. Make arrangements for the return of
the cars we left at Auburn.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim had only an hour to get to his room and
pack his bag. He hastened there in a cab,
jammed shirts, toilet kit, underwear and other
necessities into a sturdy leather case, and
then was on his way toward the airport.</p>

<p class='c007' >At the field Carl Hunter shot one question
after another at him for the noon edition had
been delivered there. Tim answered them as
best he could and countered with one of his
own.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Did the amphibian come back here?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We haven’t seen it or heard anything. I’ve
asked other ports along the line east to keep a
lookout for it but they haven’t reported a
thing. They’ll probably stop at only the smaller
fields until they reach the east again.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Grenville Ford arrived in a speeding cab just
as the afternoon eastbound express roared over
the field and circled to point its nose into the
wind and land.</p>

<p class='c007' >“All ready?” he shot at Tim as he dashed
into the ticket office.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Anxious to go,” replied the flying reporter.</p>

<p class='c007' >By the time the big twin-motored all-metal
transport was in the hangar Ford had
reappeared with their tickets in one hand and
baggage checks in the other.</p>

<p class='c007' >The eastbound express had been bucking
headwinds all afternoon and as a result was ten
minutes late. Every effort was made to cut
down the time required for refueling and Tim
and Ford were hurried aboard the
ten-passenger plane and shown their seats with little
ceremony. Their baggage was placed in the
special compartment in the rear of the plane.</p>

<p class='c007' >While the co-pilot superintended the
refueling and oiling of the super-charged motors,
the chief pilot scanned the weather reports in
the radio room. The ground crew fairly ran
from one task to another and less than ten
minutes after landing, the big ship was ready to
take off.</p>

<p class='c007' >The chief pilot took a final glance at the
weather chart, then entered the cabin and made
his way to the cockpit up ahead. The blocks
were pulled from the wheels, the landing stage
pulled into the clear, and with a deep
drumming of the motors they rolled out of the
hangar.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim, looking from a window, saw Carl
Hunter waving at him. Then they were
swinging down the runway, headed on the first lap of
what was to be Tim’s greatest adventure.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c005'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN<br /> <br />The <i>S-18</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >The next morning found Tim in New
York, actively engaged in plans for the
trip into the Caribbean. While Ford completed
negotiations for the purchase of the <i>S-18</i>, the
government submarine which the navy was
forced to scrap by treaty limitations, Tim
called at the office of the New York Journal.</p>

<p class='c007' >The managing editor was enthusiastic over
the chance for exclusive stories on the
expedition in return for relaying the radio stories on
to the <i>News</i>. At his request, Tim sat down and
wrote a two-column story on the plans for the
treasure hunt. Ford had lifted restrictions on
publicity for he realized that nothing said in
print would deter Jack Sladek from his
attempt to find the treasure first.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim met Ford at their hotel at noon and the
leader of the expedition was jubilant.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve completed the purchase and the <i>S-18</i>
is being towed from the Brooklyn navy yard
right now down to a yard where it will be
fitted out for the trip.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What about a crew?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s not going to be as difficult as it
seems. There are a lot of old navy men
drifting around New York who are always itching
for an adventure. A trip like this will appeal to
them and I’ll be able to round up enough
submarine experts to fill out the crew we need. I’m
inserting an ad in the morning papers.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Isn’t there a chance Sladek may try and
ring in a few of his men in your crew?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll have to guard against that,” admitted
Ford, “but it’s a chance I’ll have to take.”
After lunch they departed for Brooklyn and
the Laidlaw private shipyard where the <i>S-18</i>
was to be outfitted for the cruise.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was Tim’s first glimpse of a real submarine
and he stood for several minutes gazing at the
smooth, glistening grey hull in the water
beside the dock.</p>

<p class='c007' >The <i>S-18</i> had been started in 1920 and
completed two years later. The sub was 240 feet
long and ahead of the conning tower was the
turret which housed the four-inch gun. The
craft was a picture of sinister power and Tim
felt just a little shivery as he stepped down the
gangway which led from the dock onto the
narrow deck.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What do you think of it?” asked Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’d a whole lot rather make the trip in an
airplane,” admitted Tim, “but I guess I’ll get
used to it.”</p>

<p class='c007' >They climbed through the main hatch and
descended into the control room. A mass of
gauges and polished brass wheels greeted Tim’s
eyes. The rounded hull was painted a flat white
and the air was a trifle stuffy. It was all a
Chinese puzzle to him.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ford, talking rapidly, pointed to depth
gauge, periscope controls, ballast tank valves
and a score of other devices that had little
meaning for Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This is the heart of the submarine,”
explained Ford. “From this point every
movement and action is directed.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Somewhere aft was a steady clanging and
they made their way toward it, ducking their
heads under the low doors which separated the
various compartments.</p>

<p class='c007' >Directly back of the control room were the
huge Diesel engines which propelled the <i>S-18</i>
when it was running on the surface. Bank after
bank of cylinders were ranged on each side of
the steel runway. Each engine was capable of
generating 900 horsepower and the two of
them could force the submarine along at
fourteen knots an hour on the surface.</p>

<p class='c007' >Behind the engine room were the electric
motors which propelled the craft when it was
submerged. There were two of these,
developing between them 1,500 horsepower. The
underwater speed of the <i>S-18</i> was rated at
eleven knots an hour. In this room was located
the master switchboard for the complicated
electrical devices on which the life of the
submarine depended so much of the time when it
was underwater.</p>

<p class='c007' >They continued their tour of inspection,
drawing nearer the sound of the steady
hammering. In the next compartment they
discovered the cause of the noise. A red-haired
youth a little older than Tim was banging away
industriously with a hammer at the bent end
of a bunk which he had lowered from its place
on the wall.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s the matter, Pat?” asked Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >The red-haired young man looked up
quickly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hello, Mr. Ford. I’ve picked out my bunk
and I’m doing what I can to get the dents out of
this end.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m glad it’s nothing more serious. For a
while I thought someone was trying to take my
submarine apart.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The young man with the hammer
straightened up and looked Tim over with cool,
impudent eyes.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You two might as well get acquainted right
now,” said Ford, “for you’re going to see a
whole lot of each other in the coming weeks.
Tim, I want you to know Pat Reynolds, who
next to me will be in actual charge of the
operation of the submarine. I consider Pat one of the
finest submarine men in the world. He was
with Sir Francis Habernicht on his submarine
trip under the Arctic ice and it was due solely
to Pat’s cool-headedness that they came
through alive.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim stuck out his hand and Pat grasped it
firmly. There was an instant bond of liking
between them.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ford went on to explain Tim’s presence.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If it hadn’t been for Murphy I might not be
here right now,” he said. “Tim and his flying
companion kept Jack Sladek from getting me
in the Cedar river valley. Tim’s going to be a
mighty valuable member of the expedition for
I’ve decided to take along a small seaplane and
he’s to do the flying.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I didn’t know you were going to take a
plane,” said Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Neither did I until this morning. Word
came to me that Sladek is back in New York
and is busy now outfitting a tramp steamer.
He’s taking a plane and I don’t want to feel
that he has any advantage which I can not
overcome.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“But where can we carry an airplane on a
submarine?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll have to have special rigging placed on
the deck ahead of the gun turret. We’ll be
running above water all of the way to the island
and when we arrive we can unload the plane
and after that keep it moored on the beach.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“This expedition commences to look like a
humdinger,” grinned Pat. “I wouldn’t miss it
for anything.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“There will be plenty of excitement if
Sladek can do anything about it,” conceded
Ford, “I’ve got a great many things to do in
New York this afternoon. Pat, you finish the
tour of the submarine with Murphy.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The commander of the treasure hunting
expedition departed and left Tim in the tail of
the sub with Pat Reynolds.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This is the last compartment,” explained
Pat, pointing to the bunks which ranged along
the walls. “We’ll be carrying a small crew so
this is where we’ll be living for the next couple
of months. There’s another compartment for
crew’s quarters up ahead but we’ll probably use
that to store diving apparatus and to pack it
full of stores and other equipment we’ll be
needing.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim was looking at the rear bulkhead and
Pat followed with his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s the aft torpedo tube,” he said,
pointing to the heavy steel breech through
which the tube was loaded. “The torpedo rack
is just to the right but I don’t imagine we’ll be
carrying any torpedoes with us this trip.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I thought it was impossible to get them for
private use.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s supposed to be, but Ford has ways of
getting things he wants. He was one of the
navy’s ace undersea commanders during the
World War and the department hasn’t
forgotten his fine work. There’s such a thing as
loaning a torpedo for experimental work. Of
course it is just possible that the torpedo might
be lost during the experiments.” Pat grinned
broadly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Is that the same reason this sub has been left
so completely equipped, even to the four-inch
gun?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat nodded.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s one of them. Another is an
unhealthy dislike of Uncle Sam for our friend
Sladek. Federal officers have been after him
for months but so far they haven’t been able
to get anything on him that would warrant a
trial. None of them would be sorry if Sladek
just didn’t return from the Caribbean.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c005'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN<br /> <br />An Unknown Intruder</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >Pat started forward and Tim followed
him through the motor room, the engine
room back into the control room, and then into
the forward compartments.</p>

<p class='c007' >Just ahead of the control room was a small
cubby with a maze of electrical devices.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You might call this the eyes and ears of the
sub,” said Pat. “Here are the listening devices
by which we can ascertain how far away a ship
is, and the radio equipment. This is a special
compartment built for just this type of
submarine.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Don’t the newer ones have it?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes. Even more elaborate than ours and the
equipment in them is located in the main
control room.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ahead of the radio room was a white-walled
compartment which had been stripped of its
former equipment.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This used to be crew’s quarters, but when
Ford got an option on the <i>S-18</i>, the bunks and
lockers were taken out. Our diving equipment
and stores will be kept here.”</p>

<p class='c007' >They went on, ducking their heads to enter
the forward torpedo room. In the bulkhead
Tim saw the breeches of four powerful tubes.
The cranes which lifted the torpedoes from
the racks and into the tubes were folded back
against the wall but the front end of the
compartment was a maze of gauges and valve
wheels.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t see how you can remember which
valve is which and what all of the gauges
mean,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It does take a couple of months to get the
hang of all of them,” admitted Pat, “but in a
fully manned navy submarine each man is
trained for his own task. The successful
operation depends upon each one doing his job at
just the right time. If someone forgets, then the
story makes the front page and the navy goes
hunting for another lost submarine.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim felt an uncomfortable feeling in the pit
of his stomach. He knew the <i>S-18</i> was going to
be undermanned, but then the only diving they
intended to do would be at the actual scene of
the salvage operations.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This torpedo compartment will be made
into a diving room,” went on Pat. “A special
bulkhead will be built to reinforce the regular
one and a door cut in the side of the hull
through which the diver can walk when we
settle down on the bottom beside the
Southern Queen. If we find the treasure it can be
placed directly in this special room, the diver
can climb in after, and up we’ll go.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The description sounded simple enough but
Tim had misgivings that the actual operation
might be a little more complicated.</p>

<p class='c007' >They left the forward torpedo room and
started back to the control room. In the
former crew’s quarters, Pat tapped the steel deck.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The storage batteries which operate the
electric motors are under here. It’s just too bad
for us if water gets to them while we’re down
in the bottom. Then there’s chlorine gas and
unless we get up in a hurry, the party’s over.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re certainly painting a cheerful
picture of this trip,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m making it just as bad as I can,” grinned
Pat, “but you don’t seem to scare much.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s a good thing you can’t see how fast my
pulse is running. Just one more thing I want
to know right now. Where do we eat aboard
this tin fish?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“A newspaper reporter would think of
that,” chuckled Pat, “As a matter of fact the
galley will be installed in the rear torpedo
room. The entire crew will eat and sleep there
and rations won’t be anything fancy.”</p>

<p class='c007' >A watchman at the shipyard boarded the
<i>S-18</i> and informed Tim that Mr. Ford wanted
to talk to him by telephone.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim hastened out of the submarine and
followed the watchman to his shanty near the
main gate of the big yard.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m at the office of the Sea King Airplane
Company on Lower Broadway,” said Ford.
“Come over as soon as possible and we’ll make
the final decision on the type of plane we’re
going to take with us.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim promised to get across the river as
rapidly as possible and ran back to the <i>S-18</i>.
Shouting down the main hatch, he informed
Pat that he was leaving. Then he hastened
outside, flagged a cruising taxi, and sped toward
the office of the airplane company.</p>

<p class='c007' >The head of the expedition was waiting for
him in the main show room, where several
seaplanes were on display. He introduced Tim to
the company’s sales manager and they plunged
into a discussion of detail.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What do you think of this type of plane?”
Ford asked Tim, pointing to the nearest one on
the floor.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It looks sturdy enough to me,” replied the
flying reporter. “What about the speed?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It will cruise comfortably at 130 and can be
pushed up to around 145,” replied the sales
manager. “The wings are hinged and can be
folded back along the fuselage.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Which will mean a saving of space, an
important factor with us,” put in Ford. “Can you
give us an actual demonstration?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s a little late to reach the plant out on
Long Island in time for trial flights this
afternoon. Couldn’t we arrange it tomorrow
morning?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ford agreed and they arranged to meet at
the office again at nine the next day.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll take that type if it proves up to
expectations after Murphy has made several test
trips,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve a great many things remaining on my
list to do for today,” said Ford as they left the
office, “and I’m a little hesitant about leaving
Pat alone on the <i>S-18</i> all night. Of course the
Laidlaw yard has plenty of watchmen but you
never can tell what Sladek may attempt. I’d
feel a little better if you would take your duffle
and go across the river and spend the night with
Pat.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I might just as well get used to sleeping on
the <i>S-18</i> now as later,” said Tim. “I’ll get my
things and be over at the yard in less than an
hour.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The flying reporter checked out of the hotel
where they had registered that morning and
stopped at an army goods store where he
purchased three blankets and two kits of utensils.
Then he taxied over to Brooklyn, stopped at
a food store to lay in a supply of cold meat,
bread, butter, potato chips, a sack of fruit and
some small chocolate cakes. His arms were
filled when he finally reached the gate of the
shipyard and was admitted.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re just in time. I was getting ready to
close the gate for the night,” the watchman
informed him. “Mr. Ford has given strict orders
about admitting anyone after six o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Two of us are to stay aboard the <i>S-18</i>
tonight to see that nothing happens,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“There’ll be no one getting through this
gate,” said the watchman firmly, but he was an
elderly man and Tim surmised that he might
enjoy an occasional nap in the darker hours of
the night.</p>

<p class='c007' >Shouting for Pat to come on deck, Tim
threw down the packages of food, the blankets
and then his own traveling bag, finally
scrambling down the ladder himself.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You look like a land crab when it comes
to getting down a ladder gracefully,” chuckled
the red-haired Pat. “Of course, there’s just a
chance you may learn while you’re on this
trip.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You may have the laugh on me when it
comes to getting around in a submarine, but
wait until I get you into the air. Believe me I’ll
show you a trick or two in an airplane.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Which is just what you won’t do,”
countered Pat. “I know when I’m well enough off
and the <i>S-18</i> suits me. No wings, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c007' >With dusk softening the hard outlines of
the shipyard, Tim descended into the interior
of the <i>S-18</i>, where the bright glow of the
electrics dispelled the gloom.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Ford send you back to keep me company
or is he afraid we may have visitors?” asked Pat
as they placed Tim’s duffle in the crew’s
quarters.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Both. He isn’t going to take any chances on
accidents if it can be avoided. The watchman
at the main gate told me that strict orders had
been issued to admit no one after six o’clock.”
Pat nodded toward the river. “They’ll come
from there if they come. Have you got a gun?”
Tim pulled a sturdy .38 revolver from his
traveling bag.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat whistled. “That’s a real popgun. How
about a permit to carry it? You don’t want to
run into trouble in New York.”</p>

<p class='c007' >From his billfold Tim produced the small
card which identified him as a member of the
state police of his own state.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Say, what are you,” asked Pat
incredulously, “A reporter or a policeman?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m a reporter first of all, but once or twice
I’ve had to serve as a policeman,” grinned Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, officer, let’s have that grub,” said
Pat, opening the packages Tim had brought.</p>

<p class='c007' >They lowered another bunk and spread the
food out on it.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Gosh, but this tastes good,” Pat said. “I
forgot all about getting anything this noon.”</p>

<p class='c007' >They were both the possessors of hearty
appetites and between them they cleaned up
every bit of food Tim had brought aboard.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat leaned back against the steel wall.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Anyone could come aboard now and steal
the <i>S-18</i>. I’m so full of food I wouldn’t be able
to move.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I feel about the same way,” conceded Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >But despite their sluggishness no disaster
befell the <i>S-18</i> and after a time they bestirred
themselves to make a final tour of inspection of
the submarine.</p>

<p class='c007' >Across the East river gleamed the millions of
lights of Manhattan, and Tim, fascinated,
stared at the majestic scene. A tramp steamer,
outward bound for some distant port, hooted
dismally as it swung down stream. Lights in the
boatyard itself were few and far between and
there was a distinct feeling of isolation to the
flying reporter on the deck of the <i>S-18</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >While Tim was on deck, Pat closed all of
the doors between the forward compartments,
then joined Tim in front of the conning tower.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m not looking for any trouble,” he said,
“but I’ve made everything tight. The only
possible entrance will be through the main hatch
and I’m going to fix up a bunk and sleep in the
control room.”</p>

<p class='c007' >They went below and rigged makeshift beds
on the steel floor below the conning tower. Pat
found a trouble light with a long extension cord
and he placed this on the deck outside the main
hatch. With the lights off in the control room,
it would be impossible for anyone to get down
the hatch without being silhouetted in the glow
of the electric on the deck.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I guess we can go to sleep without much
worry now,” said Pat, kicking off his shoes and
rolling into his blankets.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good night,” said Tim, pulling his own
blankets around him. The steel deck was
anything but comfortable but after the flight from
Atkinson and the busy day in New York, Tim
soon dropped into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was sometime after midnight when he
awoke with a feeling of alarm gripping him.
He looked toward the hatch above. The light
was out. Someone was in the control room!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c005'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN<br /> <br />The First Test</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >There was no actual sound to which
Tim could attribute his sudden
awakening, but he was certain someone was in the
control room beside Pat for he could hear the
steady breathing of his companion.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim forced sleep from his tired brain. He
needed every faculty to meet this emergency.</p>

<p class='c007' >His right hand moved cautiously and his
fingers closed around the hard, cold butt of his
revolver. There was a slight scraping sound
from the dense blackness at the base of the
ladder which came down from the main hatch
and Tim wished for a flashlight. He didn’t even
know where the switch which controlled the
interior lights of the <i>S-18</i> was located.</p>

<p class='c007' >Only the slightest of shuffling sounds warned
Tim that the intruder was coming toward him.
Evidently he was in his stocking feet.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim managed to free his legs from the folds
of his blankets and he crouched on the steel
floor of the <i>S-18</i>, ready for whatever might
happen.</p>

<p class='c007' >The hatch which led to the main deck was
visible for the sky outside was much lighter
than the black interior of the submarine. In this
circle Tim saw the head of a man peer into
the control room. Unless he did something at
once, the <i>S-18</i> soon might be swarming with
unwanted visitors.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim heard a slight grunt as the man coming
toward him struck his head on the lower end
of one of the periscopes. That was all Tim
needed. Throwing his strength into the effort,
he lunged forward, his outstretched arms
enfolding the legs of the intruder. They went
down with a crash that brought a muffled cry
of alarm from the man Tim had tackled and
a real shout of agony from Pat, on whom they
had fallen.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s going on here?” cried Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t know,” gasped Tim, “but someone
turned off the light over the hatch and came
down here. I just tackled him and there’s
another fellow at the hatch about ready to
come down.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The man Tim had tackled recovered
suddenly from the surprise attack and struck out
with a vigor that caught the flying reporter. A
powerful foot struck Tim on the chest and
sent him flying across the control room to land
on the other side curled against a maze of pipes
and valve wheels.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Have you got him?” cried Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not now,” Tim replied. “He kicked me
almost through the side of this tin fish. You try
and get him.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll get him all right,” vowed Pat. “You
keep the boy at the hatch from joining him
and making this too much of a party.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Flame lighted the interior of the control
room and their eardrums were almost shattered
by the deafening roar of a gun discharged at
close range. The man Tim had tackled was
shooting at the sound of their voices.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Never mind trying to get this fellow,”
called Pat, now safely protected by the
bulkhead into the engine room. “We’ll pick him off
when he tries to return to the deck.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The answer to Pat’s words were written in
smoke and flame as the unknown intruder fired
again.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim, watching the outline of the hatch
against the sky, saw a head appear. He raised
his gun and fired in the general direction of the
hatch, more to scare the second man than to
actually harm him. On the echo of the crash of
his gun came a scream of pain and the head
promptly disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good shooting!” cried Pat. “Now we’ll
get this fellow. He’s in a cross fire. Next time
he shoots let him have it. I’ll see if I can get
around to the switch and turn on the lights.
This party is going to end all of a sudden.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim strained his senses to detect the spot
where the gunman was hidden. He could hear
cautious sounds but he didn’t dare fire for fear
of hitting Pat. Tim edged near the ladder which
led up to the hatch. As he neared it he became
conscious of some one crawling up the ladder
and he lunged toward the shadowy form.</p>

<p class='c007' >Just as Tim moved, the man on the ladder
lashed out viciously with one foot. The blow
caught Tim squarely on the chin and he
dropped to the deck, out cold. His gun clattered
from his nerveless hands and the man on the
ladder leaped for the hatch just as the interior of
the <i>S-18</i> blazed with light.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat, momentarily blinded by the glare,
recovered in time to see the legs of their assailant
disappearing over the edge of the hatch and
with snap aim he sent a volley of shots crashing
upward.</p>

<p class='c007' >Feet pounded along the deck of the <i>S-18</i>
and Pat heard the sudden splashing of oars as
a small boat pulled away from the hull of the
sub in great haste. Pursuit, he knew, was
useless and he bent over Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >The flying reporter was recovering his
senses, but he was still groggy from the sharp
blow on his chin. His first thought was one of
self defense and he struggled weakly to raise
his fists and hammer at Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Snap out of it,” said Pat, shaking Tim
gently. “The show’s all over and we’re still
in command of the fort.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim smiled a little sheepishly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Someone certainly landed a haymaker on
me.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You mean a No. 11 shoe connected with
your chin at about sixty miles an hour,”
chuckled Pat. “A kick like that would have
killed anyone but an Irishman.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim shook himself to make sure that he was
still all together and got to his feet. He was still
a little shaky.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You stay down here while I go on deck
and see what it was all about,” said Pat. He
climbed nimbly up the ladder and disappeared
just as cries sounded along the dock.</p>

<p class='c007' >“On board the submarine,” boomed a heavy
voice. “What’s the matter down there?”</p>

<p class='c007' >A beam of light cut through the night and
outlined Pat as he stood on the deck.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Someone tried to board us and we had to
call out our own riot squad,” yelled Pat.
“Looks like everything is all right now and I
don’t think we’ll have any more visitors
tonight.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Satisfied, the watchman returned and Pat
called down for Tim to hand up another bulb
to replace the one which had been taken from
the light over the hatch.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m sure we won’t have any more callers,”
he said, “but this light may discourage them
even though it didn’t the first time. How in the
dickens did you happen to wake up?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You might call it my ‘news sense’ being on
the job,” said Tim as he rubbed his bruised chin.
“The first thing I sensed was that the light was
out. Then I knew someone was moving around
in the control room and after that I was almost
too scared to move.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Seems to me you did a pretty nice job of
tackling, but the next time don’t bring your
man down on top of me. It’s an awful shock to
awake in the middle of the night and find a
first class fight taking place right in your
midships.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim glanced at his wrist watch.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s one a.m.,” he said. “What’s on the
schedule now?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We might as well try and get a little more
sleep. I think the fireworks are over for
tonight.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat rolled back into his blankets and a minute
later Tim followed his companion’s action
but where Pat was soon in a deep sleep, Tim
remained awake, thinking over the attack and
the dangers of their long voyage into the
Caribbean. He was glad Commander Ford had
decided to take a seaplane on the trip. It made him
feel more comfortable for if anything
happened to the <i>S-18</i> on the treasure hunt, they
might be able to get word of their plight to the
world by using the seaplane.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim finally slept and when he awoke,
sunlight was streaming down through the hatch
and Commander Ford was climbing aboard.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Fine pair of watchmen I left,” he smiled.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You left one mighty alert one,” put in Pat,
and he recounted their experiences of the night.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sladek is certainly losing no time in trying
to hamper my plans,” said Ford. “I imagine
he’ll attempt to trail us all of the way to the
island but we may fool him if we decide to travel
underwater for a few miles.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“But you couldn’t do that with the plane on
deck,” protested Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We might release the plane and have you
fly on ahead, meeting us at the rendezvous on
the island,” suggested Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >If Tim thought his days on the <i>News</i> had
been busy, they were nothing compared with
the bustle of activity which settled down on
the <i>S-18</i>. For his own part, he was busy testing
the seaplanes at the Sea King factory and he
finally selected the craft which the sales
manager had recommended. It was a three passenger
job, light but sturdy and exceptionally easy
to handle.</p>

<p class='c007' >For the next week Tim went to the airplane
plant daily to take special instructions in the
handling of the plane and to learn the trick of
getting off choppy water for there was no
telling in what kind of weather he might be called
upon to make a flight.</p>

<p class='c007' >The fuel tanks were enlarged to give the
speedy craft a cruising radius of a thousand
miles and the pontoons were especially
reinforced for the rough work which Tim and his
plane might encounter.</p>

<p class='c007' >By the end of the week great changes had
been effected in the hull of the <i>S-18</i>. Steel
workers had cut out the special diving chamber
in the forward torpedo room, the galley had
been installed in the rear compartment which
was the crew’s quarters, a special radio set
capable of communicating instantly with the
New York Journal office was in place, and
many other minor alterations necessary for the
cruise had been made. The crew was being
increased daily, but it was not until the first mess
was served on board that Tim had a chance to
see them together. In all, sixteen men were to
make the trip into the Caribbean and Tim
looked at them with interest as they sat around
the table for the evening meal.</p>

<p class='c007' >At the head of the table was Commander
Ford and at the other end Pat Reynolds. Tim
sat at Pat’s right. Ranged up and down each
side were the other thirteen, George Gadd,
the engineer, Fred Hanson, the chief
electrician, Joe Gartner, old navy torpedoman and
gunner, Charlie Gill and Russ Graham, deep
sea divers, and their assistants, Earl Bell and
Roy Gould.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ike Green was the radio operator while
Forman Gay, Erich Gaunt, Sam Schneider, Al
Hardy and Tom Grandrath were former
submarine men who would assist in the general
operation of the submarine. With the
exception of Pat, Tim and Ike Green, the radioman,
and the divers, all of the others had served with
Ford during the war. The divers and their
assistants were old navy men who could be relied
upon and Tim knew that Commander Ford
was taking every precaution against any
treachery among members of his own crew.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was a clean, hard-bitten crew that could
be depended upon in any emergency.</p>

<p class='c007' >The Commander, Ford was discussing final
plans.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’re going down the sound for a trial run
tomorrow morning. If everything goes well,
we’ll start south the day after tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Early the next morning lines were cast off
and the <i>S-18</i>, pulsating to the clicking of her
powerful Diesels, was backed slowly away
from the shipyard. A tug stood by to give any
assistance needed, but the <i>S-18</i> cleared the yard
and nosed slowly down river. Overhead a
seaplane wheeled.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim was in the conning tower with
Commander Ford and he pointed upward.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That must be Sladek’s plane, keeping track
of us,” nodded Ford. “I understand his ship
is ready to go at a moment’s notice. He’s
gathered a crew of thirty of the toughest
characters on the waterfront and promised them
all a good slice of the bullion if he gets it.
Knowing Sladek as I do, I wouldn’t put much
faith in his word if I were a member of that
crew.”</p>

<p class='c007' >When the <i>S-18</i> was clear of the lower bay,
the warning bell sounded and everyone on
deck went below. Hatches were made fast and
every member of the crew went to his station.
For Tim there was nothing to do but stand in
the control room and watch the activities of the
others for he was not experienced enough in
submarine operation to be placed at one of the
important posts.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford’s commands were crisp
and alert. The Diesels were silent and only the
faint humming of the big electric motors could
be heard. Then the <i>S-18</i> moved on a slight
angle and Tim knew they were going below.
He had encountered a good many queer
sensations in an airplane, but none quite so alarming
as the one which gripped him now. He was
actually going under the surface with only the
thin steel walls of the submarine to ward off
the destructive force of the water.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim glanced around the control room.
Commander Ford was standing with his eyes glued
to the periscope. Pat was at the main diving
rudders. Forman Gay and Erich Gaunt were
at the valves which controlled the ballast tanks.
All were silent, intent on their work.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Are the forward ballast tanks flooded?”
snapped the commander.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes sir,” replied Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How about the after tanks?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’re flooded.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then level off and hold her at forty feet.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The submarine resumed her even keel, but
Tim knew they were forty feet below the
surface.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford left his post and visited
each compartment, making sure that
everything was functioning smoothly. When he
returned, he said calmly: “We’ll go a little
deeper.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The diving rudders were inclined again and
the <i>S-18</i> nosed its way deeper into the water.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim watched the depth gauge, fascinated.
The needle was marking the distance steadily.
Sixty, seventy, eighty feet they went. Now
they were moving downward again. Ninety,
ninety-five and then a hundred.</p>

<p class='c007' >George Gadd, the engineer, came into the
control room.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Everything’s all right so far,” he reported.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then we’ll go the rest of the way,” decided
Commander Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim knew what the order meant. They were
going to the bottom, going down to make
absolutely sure that the <i>S-18</i> was ready for the
Caribbean treasure hunt.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c005'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN<br /> <br />On the Bottom</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >The depth gauge was dropping steadily
as the <i>S-18</i> plunged downward through
the black waters. From Commander Ford on
down, everyone was tense. This was the big
test. If anything went wrong—</p>

<p class='c007' >But they couldn’t think of that, that is, no
one except Tim who had nothing else to do.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Ease off on the diving rudders,” snapped
Commander Ford. “We’re almost down.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“How’s the bottom?” asked George Gadd.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Charts show it to be good and firm. We’ll
just touch and then start up again.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The depth gauge showed 205 feet when
there was a gentle scraping sound and the <i>S-18</i>
came to rest on the bottom of the sound. Beads
of water were standing all over the interior of
the glistening white hull for the pressure at
that depth was tremendous.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford left his post and made a
thorough tour of the submarine. When he
returned he was obviously elated.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Everything’s holding fine,” he said. “Now
we’ll get ready to return to the surface.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Orders flew rapidly. The diving planes were
readjusted and Forman Gay and Erich Gaunt
stood ready to blow the ballast from the
diving tanks and lighten the sub for the rise to the
surface.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Blow the tanks,” ordered the Commander.</p>

<p class='c007' >Compressed air hissed through the high
pressure lines and Tim knew that despite the
pressure of the water at that depth the air was
blowing the ballast from the tanks. In a
moment or two the <i>S-18</i> would quiver, come to
life, and start the upward ascent.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford was watching the gauges
intently. There was no movement of the <i>S-18</i>
and he turned toward Gay and Gaunt.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’re giving the tanks all we’ve got,” said
Gaunt. “There’s 1,500 pounds of air pressure
pushing that water out.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hold it for a minute,” ordered Ford as
Charlie Gill, the chief diver, stumbled into the
room.</p>

<p class='c007' >Charlie’s face was white, strained.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’re stuck, chief, we’re stuck. This
bottom is as soft as a mud pie and the current
has rammed us against the side of an old
derelict. We’re settling deeper into the stuff every
minute.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Stand by your posts,” cried the
Commander. Grabbing Gill by the shoulder, he
hurried him forward. Tim, who had no duty to
attend, followed them into the diving
compartment where a special quartz window to observe
diving operations had been placed. A powerful
searchlight had been turned on by Gill and it
revealed the trap into which the <i>S-18</i> had
settled. They were tight against the
slime-encrusted hull of an old barge, probably a
garbage scow used in hauling the refuse from
New York City.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That also explains the soft bottom,” said
Ford. “They’ve been dumping garbage out
here.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It may make garbage of us,” said Gill
bitterly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Can you get into your diving outfit and get
outside and place a bomb?” asked the
Commander.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not at this depth. I’ve got to be in the
diving compartment and come down gradually.
The pressure would break me in two if I walked
out there now.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then how about a bomb?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We could get that outside, but it’s hard to
tell where it will go off. If it’s too close to the
hull, it might crush us and you know the answer
to that.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford nodded. “We’ll try it
again.”</p>

<p class='c007' >He returned to the control room where the
motors were raced first ahead and then in
reverse, but the <i>S-18</i> failed to rise out of the muck
and instead seemed to be burrowing its way
further into the soft stuff.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford ordered the motors cut
out and called the crew into the control room.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’re in a jam,” he said. “You know as
well as I do that we can’t expect help from the
surface in time to do us any good. If we escape
we’ve got to do it ourselves and there’s only
one way. That’s by using one of the special
depth bombs and hoping it will jar us loose.
There’s a chance the explosion may crush our
own hull, but that’s a risk we’ll have to take.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Let’s get it over with,” put in the chief
electrician. “I was on the bottom of the English
channel for twelve hours in a sub during the
war and this waiting is awful.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The rest of the crew voiced the sentiments
of the chief electrician. Pat was placed in charge
of the control room while Commander Ford
and Charlie Gill and Russ Graham, the divers,
and Joe Gartner, the torpedo man and gunner,
went ahead to make preparations to explode
the bomb.</p>

<p class='c007' >The explosive was dangerous stuff and none
of them relished handling it, but in it they saw
their one chance of escape. The bomb was in
a special steel case with a small aperture in
which the timing device was located. The fuse
was set for five minutes and the bomb placed
in the diving chamber.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim’s nerves felt shaky. The bomb was
going now. In just five minutes the deadly blast
would go off. If they didn’t get it out of the
diving chamber and against the derelict, there
wouldn’t be a ghost of a chance for them.</p>

<p class='c007' >But Charlie Gill and Russ Graham were
versatile men. They had been in plenty of tight
places before. Working quickly and surely,
they opened the outer door of the diving
chamber. At that depth a terrific spray of water shot
into the inner chamber and the bomb bobbed
from side to side. Then the force of the water
pushed it outside the hull of the submarine. In
the glow from the searchlight they saw the
bomb drift away from the side of the
submarine. The same current which was holding
the <i>S-18</i> fast against the derelict was driving the
bomb against it.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford, watch in hand, was
counting the seconds.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Better close the outer door of the diving
compartment,” he told Charlie Gill. “There’s
little more than a minute left.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The Commander of the <i>S-18</i> hurried back to
the control room.</p>

<p class='c007' >“On the alert,” he told the men. “Everyone
be ready for double quick action. There’s
thirty seconds left before the bomb explodes.”
Tim glanced around the room. Erich Gaunt
and Forman Gay were bent over the levers
which controlled the ballast tanks. Pat was
tense at the diving rudders while back in the
motor room George Gadd stood by to help the
chief electrician. The crew of the <i>S-18</i> was
ready.</p>

<p class='c007' >The flying reporter was fascinated as the
second hand of his own watch ticked off the
precious seconds. It might be ticking life and death
for all aboard the <i>S-18</i>, 205 feet below the
surface of the sound.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ten, seven, five, three seconds left.</p>

<p class='c007' >A muffled explosion shook the hull of the
<i>S-18</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Motors full ahead!” shouted Commander
Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >The powerful electrics leaped into action.
The steel deck beneath them quivered.</p>

<p class='c007' >They were moving! It was slow at first, but
the <i>S-18</i> was shaking the slime of the bottom off
its hull.</p>

<p class='c007' >Then, with a sickening leap, they shot
upward, motors on full, diving planes at the
sharpest angle.</p>

<p class='c007' >Men tumbled around in the control room
like dry leaves before an autumn gale. The
<i>S-18</i>, out of control, was shooting toward the
surface.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat managed to scramble to his feet and
seized the wheel which controlled the forward
diving rudders. With a quick twist he lessened
the sharp angle of their ascent.</p>

<p class='c007' >Before the other men could crawl back to
their stations, the grey nose of the submarine
shot above the surface of the sound. It must
have risen ten feet out of water, then as the
rest of the sub came to the surface, slapped
back into the water with a resounding crash.
Everyone aboard was jarred by the shock.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Tanks clear of water, diving planes
normal?” Questions shot from the lips of
Commander Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >Before the main hatch was opened and the
sunlight streamed in, he made sure that the
<i>S-18</i> had not been seriously damaged by its
sudden rise. In spite of the great pressure, not
a seam in the hull had been opened and the
crew scrambled out on deck for a breath of
fresh air.</p>

<p class='c007' >The seaplane was still circling overhead and
with a shock Tim realized they had been on
the bottom less than half an hour. It had seemed
a lifetime.</p>

<p class='c007' >To the veteran submarine men the
harrowing experience on the bottom of the sound
seemed all in the day’s work, but to Tim it was
an incident he would remember all the rest of
his life.</p>

<p class='c007' >“No more garbage scows for mine,” grinned
Pat. “That was a little too close for comfort.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’d just as soon fly down to the Caribbean,”
said Tim as he watched the seaplane gracefully
circling overhead.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford joined them.</p>

<p class='c007' >“After that test there’s no question about
the seaworthiness of the <i>S-18</i>. We’re putting
back to the Laidlaw yard at once. We’ll start
south sometime tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c007' >That was news and Tim went below and
dictated a story to Ike Green, who sent it to
the Journal station. It was the first story sent
directly from the <i>S-18</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >That night when they were back in the yard,
a truck lumbered through the main gate, a
winch on the dock clattered noisily and a long,
cigar-shaped object came slowly down. A
forward hatch was opened and the torpedo locked
securely in its rack. After that a case of shells
for the four-inch gun and three machine guns
and a half dozen automatic rifles and sixteen
revolvers with plenty of ammunition were
lowered from the dock.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’re going to be something of a floating
arsenal,” chuckled Pat. “Believe me, if we get
in a jam old Joe Gartner is a handy man with
the four-inch gun.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What about Sladek and his expedition?”
Tim asked.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Commander Ford told me this afternoon
they were ready to sail at a moment’s notice.
We’ll be slipping away tomorrow night which
may cause them a little trouble in following us.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The next day Tim went to the Sea King
factory on Long Island and made sure his plane
was ready. Then he wrote the final stories of
plans for the departure and sent them to both
the New York Journal and the <i>News</i> at home,
with release dates for the next day, when they
would be well out to sea and off the Jersey
coast.</p>

<p class='c007' >A subdued air of excitement gripped the
crew of the <i>S-18</i>. This was the big night. Before
midnight they would be headed down the East
river, bound for the open sea and the start of
the big adventure.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c005'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN<br /> <br />The Missing Cook</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >Across the East river the lights of
Manhattan glowed brightly while in the
Laidlaw yard last minute preparations for the
voyage of the <i>S-18</i> were being rushed. Supplies
were being checked and every possible test of
equipment was made.</p>

<p class='c007' >In the radio room Ike Green got in contact
with the New York Journal station and Tim
filed his last story. The next would be sent when
the <i>S-18</i> was out to sea.</p>

<p class='c007' >A whistle shrilled on the deck overhead and
Tim mounted the ladder and climbed through
the main hatch. Riding lights of the submarine
were on. Yard workers were casting off the
lines which held the <i>S-18</i> to the towering dock.</p>

<p class='c007' >The huge Diesels came to life and the
submarine pulsated gently to their song of power.
Commander Ford was at his station in the
conning tower while near him at the auxiliary
controls was Pat Reynolds. Half a dozen other
members of the crew were on deck.</p>

<p class='c007' >Down in the inky waters at the rear of the
<i>S-18</i> the propellers churned. Slowly the
submarine nosed away from the boatyard, heading
out toward the East river. There was no sound
from the workers on the dock; no sound from
the men on deck. This business of hunting
sunken treasures was deadly serious.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was little traffic on the river after the
midnight hour and the <i>S-18</i> felt its way out
into mid-stream and then dropped down
toward the open sound.</p>

<p class='c007' >Somewhere behind them a ferryboat hooted
dismally and a tramp steamer, just swinging out
of its wharf, answered.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Any chance that that vessel may be
Sladek’s?” Tim asked Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“There’s more than a chance. It probably
is,” replied the first officer.</p>

<p class='c007' >The submarine moved down the bay at a
steady eight knots an hour and Tim watched
the lights of Manhattan fading into a haze.
They stood well down the bay for the Sea
King factory was on the south shore of Long
Island.</p>

<p class='c007' >Above him in the conning tower Tim could
hear Commander Ford conversing with Pat.
Then the commander leaned over the edge of
the tower and called to the men on deck.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Everyone down below,” he said. “We’re
going to submerge and run underwater to the
Sea King plant. That may throw Sladek’s ship
off our trail.”</p>

<p class='c007' >They tumbled below, the main hatch was
sealed, and Pat checked every gauge before
Commander Ford gave the order to submerge.
The <i>S-18</i> went down twenty feet and then
levelled off, the electric motors pushing it
smoothly underwater.</p>

<p class='c007' >With his eyes glued to a periscope,
Commander Ford scanned the surface of the sound
for another craft. At almost an instant’s notice
the <i>S-18</i> was ready to dive lower.</p>

<p class='c007' >At the microphones, Ike Green was listening
intently for the beat of the propeller of the
tramp steamer. He grinned as Commander
Ford entered the tiny room.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’re puzzled,” said the radio man,
“and they’re zig-zagging all over the lower
bay.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The <i>S-18</i> continued to run underwater at a
bare four knots an hour. It was three hours
later when they came to the surface and the
sky was lighter in the east. Sunrise was less
than half an hour away. To their left was the
factory of the Sea King company and the <i>S-18</i>
nosed slowly toward the dock.</p>

<p class='c007' >As the sky brightened they saw the smudge
of a steamer well out to sea.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Unless I miss my guess there goes Jack
Sladek and his treasure-hunting expedition,”
grinned Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >The seaplane purchased for their trip was
on the dock ready and it took less than half an
hour to load the craft on the deck of the <i>S-18</i>
and make it fast.</p>

<p class='c007' >“There’ll be no more diving with that
sky-hopping bug on deck,” said Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Which will suit me all right,” replied Tim.
“Anytime you want to do a little exploring
under water in this tin fish just let me know and
I’ll cruise around in the clouds for a couple of
hours.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You may have to do that when we get
down into the Caribbean if we find Sladek too
close to our trail,” put in Commander Ford
who had come up behind them. “He’s going
to be a hard customer to lose and he’ll probably
use that seaplane of his to do a lot of scouting.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Breakfast was served by Al Hardy, who
was the cook, and they enjoyed the morning
meal before casting loose from the Sea King
dock. Then, with all hands on deck and a bright
sun shining down on them, the <i>S-18</i> resumed
its southward voyage. The next port of call
was to be Key West, where the fuel tanks
would be replenished for the voyage across
the Caribbean.</p>

<p class='c007' >Once out to sea, half of the crew turned
in, for there had been no sleep aboard the <i>S-18</i>
during the hours they had been submerged.
The Jersey coast gradually dropped from view
and they moved southward at a steady ten knots
an hour.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim sought his bunk in the after quarters.
Ahead the Diesels pounded steadily, but the
air was clean and sweet and in spite of the noise
he was soon asleep.</p>

<p class='c007' >The clatter of pans as Al Hardy prepared
the noon meal awoke him and he rejoined Pat
in the conning tower. Commander Ford was
down in the diving room talking with the chief
divers and Tim and Pat were alone.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Do you think we’re going to be in for
trouble before we get through?” Tim asked as
he watched the sharp bow of the <i>S-18</i> cut
through the gentle swells.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Commander Ford told me this morning
that Sladek had rounded up about the prize
gang of cutthroats on the New York
waterfront. You’ll get all of the excitement you want
before this shindig ends.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Just give me time enough to get aloft in the
plane and I’ll be ready for anything that comes
along,” said Tim, nodding toward the trim
seaplane lashed securely on the forward deck.</p>

<p class='c007' >Mess was served in relays that noon and
shortly after that Tim sighted the seaplane
winging up from the south.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Company coming,” he informed Pat, who
was back in the conning tower.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford was summoned and they
watched the approach of the fast craft. The
plane was flying high, but as it neared the <i>S-18</i>,
the pilot put it into a dive.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That fellow knows how to handle a plane,”
said Tim, half to himself.</p>

<p class='c007' >The seaplane came out of the dive at a
thousand feet and circled the <i>S-18</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The answer to that is plain,” said
Commander Ford grimly. “That’s Sladek’s ship and
it won’t be long until his dirty old tramp
steamer is on our trail again.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The seaplane winged away again and in less
than two hours they saw a smudge of smoke on
the horizon. Before sundown the tramp
steamer, the <i>Iron Mate</i>, was riding a half mile
off their port bow.</p>

<p class='c007' >“There’s no use trying to sneak away from
them now,” said the commander. “When we
get out of Key West and head across the
Caribbean we’ll find some way to give them the slip.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Down the east coast the <i>S-18</i> made its
leisurely way with the <i>Iron Mate</i> a constant
companion. The sky was clearer, the air warmer,
as they neared the southern tip of Florida and
nosed into the harbor at Key West. The Iron
Mate stood out to sea, waiting for the return of
the <i>S-18</i>, for Sladek was taking no chances on
getting into trouble with federal officials.</p>

<p class='c007' >The <i>S-18</i> replenished its fuel oil tanks, fresh
supplies were taken aboard, and the crew
stretched its legs before the voyage into the
Caribbean.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat and Tim strolled along the wharfs. It
was a picturesque city and they enjoyed the
walk at the sunset hour.</p>

<p class='c007' >A small boat was coming in from the sea.
They watched it curiously for the men at the
oars were particularly vicious looking.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I wouldn’t want to meet them on a dark
night,” said Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >When they returned to the <i>S-18</i>,
Commander Ford divulged his plans for eluding the
<i>Iron Mate</i> and its crew of cutthroats.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Tim,” he said, “we’ll hoist your seaplane
overboard at once. Then we’ll slip out of the
harbor and run submerged until we are well
away from the coast. You fool around here all
day tomorrow. The next morning hop early
and rejoin us at this joint.” The commander
indicated a spot in the Caribbean approximately
two hundred miles west of Key West.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sladek will probably set his pilot to
watching you when he finds we’ve given him the
slip, but I’ll expect you to elude him and join
us at the rendezvous without being followed.
A great deal will depend upon your success.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It may take some time to shake him off my
trail,” promised Tim, “but I’ll see that he
doesn’t follow me too far.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s good,” said Ford. “Now we’ll drop
your seaplane overboard and prepare to slip
out of the harbor. I’ve special clearances which
will allow our departure at any hour we care
to leave.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim directed the unloading of the Sea King
and made sure that trim little craft was fast to
the dock before he returned to the deck of the
<i>S-18</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat was checking over the crew list.
Everyone answered present except Al Hardy, the
cook.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Anyone see Al?” demanded Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He left just before sundown to get some
supplies he needed,” said Erich Gaunt. “He
should have been back half an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll wait a few minutes more,” said Pat,
hurrying below to inform Commander Ford
that the cook was missing.</p>

<p class='c007' >A half hour elapsed and Al was still among
the missing. At Commander Ford’s Order, the
crew scattered along the docks, seeking their
missing cook. By ten o’clock, with still no
trace of Al, the commander gave the order to
clear the lines. The <i>S-18</i> was going without its
cook.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Maybe you can find him in the hoosegow
in the morning,” Pat told Tim. “If you do, load
him in your plane and bring him along. We
need a good cook.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll do my best to find him,” promised Tim
as the <i>S-18</i> slipped away from the dock.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim watched the submarine until its lights
faded into the night. He made arrangements
with the watchman at the dock to keep an eye
on the seaplane. Then he turned away from
the waterfront. He was unfamiliar with the
city and he stumbled along a poorly lighted
street. From an alley to his right came a groan.
Tim hesitated. It sounded like a human being
in agony, but it might be a waterfront trap of
thugs to lure him from the street.</p>

<p class='c007' >The sound came again. There was no
mistaking it this time. Someone was in great pain.
Tim ducked into the alley. Along one wall was
a huddled form. He bent down and lifted the
man’s head. It was too dark to distinguish the
features and Tim lugged the man to the head
of the alley where the rays from a street lamp
half a block away gave him some light.</p>

<p class='c007' >He bent down again and looked into the
battered face of Al Hardy, the missing cook.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c005'>CHAPTER NINETEEN<br /> <br />The Warning Note</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >The cook of the <i>S-18</i> had been badly
beaten and Tim realized that he was in
need of immediate medical attention. He
managed to get the unconscious Hardy over his
shoulders and he staggered down the block
until he was under the street light.</p>

<p class='c007' >Glancing up and down the street, Tim saw
that he was alone. He lowered the cook from
his shoulders and laid him on the walk under
the light. Then he raced down the street
toward a cluster of lights several blocks away,
where he was fortunate enough to find a night
patrolman on duty there and the officer
summoned an ambulance.</p>

<p class='c007' >When the ambulance reached the lonely
street, they bundled the cook aboard and Tim
climbed up in the front seat beside the driver
while the interne rode inside.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was after midnight before the cook
regained consciousness and another two hours
before he was strong enough to see Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >When the flying reporter entered the
hospital room the cook looked out at him from
beneath a mass of bandages.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s got lots of endurance,” said the doctor
on duty, “or he wouldn’t have been able to live
through the terrific beating he got. Don’t talk
to him any longer than necessary.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim sat down by the bed.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Tell me what happened, Al.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The cook’s voice was little more than a
whisper and Tim leaned over to catch the words.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I was on my way back to the wharf, when
they ganged me and dragged me into a deserted
warehouse.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Even one sentence had visibly sapped his
strength and the cook rested before continuing.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They wanted to know our destination.
When I wouldn’t tell them they beat me.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim’s eyes blazed with anger. There was no
question in his mind who the “they” Al was
referring to meant. It was the boatload of
ruffians he and Pat had seen rowing in from the
open sea. Undoubtedly they were from the
<i>Iron Mate</i>, Sladek’s ship.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I went almost crazy with the pain.” There
was a choked sob in the cook’s voice. “They
burned the bottom of my feet with cigarettes.”</p>

<p class='c007' >There was a long pause and Tim waited
patiently, wondering whether Al Hardy had
finally given away the secret of their
destination.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They were going to kill me,” the cook
went on, each word an obvious effort. “Finally,
finally I told them it was an island off the coast
of Yucatan, but no one but the commander
knew what one.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Did they believe you?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They must have. That’s all I remember
until I came to in the hospital. I’m sorry I talked.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Don’t worry about that, Al,” said Tim,
gripping the cook’s hand firmly. “Any of the
rest of us would have talked a lot sooner. I’m
going to leave you now. I’ve got to contact the
<i>S-18</i> with the seaplane in the morning. I’ve
made arrangements for them to take good care
of you here. By the time you’re well we’ll be
on our way back and you’ll have a good share
of the treasure.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Before leaving the the floor, Tim stopped at
the desk.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Just how badly is he injured?” he asked the
doctor.</p>

<p class='c007' >“An average man would die from shock,
but he looks like he has a fine constitution. I
believe he’ll pull through.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“See that he has everything he needs,” said
Tim. “In case of an emergency you can
communicate with Commander Ford’s
representative in New York for further instructions.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The information Al Hardy had given made
Tim change his plans completely. Sladek and
his crew knew the <i>S-18</i> was bound for the coast
of Yucatan and Tim felt sure they would
abandon any attempt to follow the <i>S-18</i> across the
Caribbean. Instead they would use their own
seaplane to locate Commander Ford’s
expedition after it reached the island which held the
secret of the Southern Queen.</p>

<p class='c007' >To Tim it seemed the most important thing
was to get in touch with Commander Ford and
appraise him of the sudden turn in events.
Instead of waiting to keep the rendezvous on the
following day, he would attempt to overtake
the <i>S-18</i> as soon as dawn broke.</p>

<p class='c007' >On his way back to the waterfront Tim
stopped at an all-night restaurant and ate a
hearty breakfast. The watchman at the dock
lent a willing hand and by dawn Tim had the
Sea King ready to take the air.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t like the looks of the sky,” said the
watchman. “There’s wind and a nasty sea in
them clouds.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll risk it anyway,” said Tim. “It’s
important.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then keep an eye on a handy cay where
you can find shelter in the lee,” advised the
watchman as Tim started the motor of the Sea
King. The powerful engine ran true and
sweet and after getting it thoroughly warmed
up, Tim scudded across the gray water and
lifted the dripping pontoons into the sky.</p>

<p class='c007' >He knew the <i>S-18</i> would be following the
course to the rendezvous set for the next day
and he charted a compass path through the air.</p>

<p class='c007' >Key West dropped from sight in the
greyness of the morning and he winged a solitary
way out over the Caribbean. Below the swells
were sharper. It wouldn’t be easy landing and
getting the Sea King aboard the <i>S-18</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >For nearly an hour Tim bored into the west.
He should be near the <i>S-18</i> and he scanned the
surface of the ocean with anxious eyes. For half
an hour he circled in wide swoops. The wind
was freshening and the sea beneath him was
choppy when he finally sighted the conning
tower of the submarine.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim dropped down until he was just above
the surface of the water. The nose of the <i>S-18</i>
was plowing through the swells and there were
only two huddled figures in the conning tower.
Tim recognized them as he flashed by,
Commander Ford and Pat. They waved wildly as
Tim gauged the strength of wind and wave. It
was too risky to attempt a landing and he
scrawled a note on a sheet of paper and
crammed it into an old tobacco can he had found
along the waterfront and brought along for
just such a purpose.</p>

<p class='c007' >With his motor almost idling, he swept
down on the <i>S-18</i> again. Watching his speed
carefully, he hurled the tin can toward the
submarine. It landed well in front and bobbed
restless on the water.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford and Pat had seen the can
strike the surface and under their skillful hands
the submarine was brought to a halt. A wave
washed the tin alongside where another
member of the crew, who had emerged from the
control room, retrieved it, and handed the can
up to the conning tower.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat signalled that they understood the
contents of Tim’s message, and the flying reporter
zoomed the Sea King sharply in a farewell
salute as he opened the throttle and roared back
toward Key West. On the way back he sighted
the <i>Iron Mate</i> far to his right and a good thirty
miles behind the <i>S-18</i>. If anything, the
submarine was a good two knots and hour faster than
the <i>Iron Mate</i> when it was running on the
surface.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim reached Key West safely, saw that the
Sea King was refueled and ready to go on short
notice, and then went to the hospital to see the
cook. Al Hardy was sleeping soundly and Tim
continued to a hotel where he went to bed to
get some much needed rest.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was late afternoon before he awoke. He
made another call at the hospital, but was
advised not to see the cook. After supper he went
to a movie and then turned in early for with the
dawn would come another long flight.</p>

<p class='c007' >During the night the wind subsided and ideal
flying weather greeted Tim when he reached
the waterfront. The sun was casting a rosy hue
over red-tiled roofs and Tim welcomed the
chance to soar into the cool, sweet morning
air.</p>

<p class='c007' >The Sea King responded to the impulse of
the starter with a roar and Tim flashed across
the surface of the bay and into the air. He made
a half circle into the west and lined away for a
fast flight to overhaul the <i>S-18</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was better than two hours later and fifty
miles beyond their rendezvous when Tim
finally sighted the submarine, sliding through
the water at a strong twelve knots an hour.</p>

<p class='c007' >He brought the Sea King down to an easy
landing and then taxied alongside the <i>S-18</i>,
which was now lying motionless. Willing
hands helped fasten the crane and its rigging to
the seaplane and the craft was soon lodged
safely on the deck of the submarine. Then they
were under way again, the thin nose of the <i>S-18</i>
cleaving its way toward the sunken treasure in
the hold of the Southern Queen.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c005'>CHAPTER TWENTY<br /> <br />Isle of the Singing Trees</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >While Pat was on duty in the conning
tower, Tim recounted in detail to
Commander Ford just what had taken place in
Key West. When he was through the
Commander looked extremely grave.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Now that Sladek knows we are bound for
an island off the coast of Yucatan, our only
hope is for speed. It may take him several days
to locate us after we are there, but with his
seaplane he is certain to do that. We’ll continue
ahead as fast as possible and once over the
wreck of the Southern Queen we’ll lose no time
in going down and getting what we can.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Only Commander Ford knew the exact
location of the island they sought off the coast of
Yucatan. As the hours rolled into days, the
tension aboard the <i>S-18</i> grew. There had been no
further sign of the <i>Iron Mate</i> and they
wondered whether Sladek was ahead or behind.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim wrote a story each day and Ike Green
flashed it over his powerful set to the station of
the New York Journal, where it was relayed
to Tim’s own paper at Atkinson.</p>

<p class='c007' >The third night after Tim joined the <i>S-18</i>
out of Key West he felt the pulse of the
diesels slowing down. He tossed on his clothes and
made his way to the control room and climbed
the ladder to the conning tower. Commander
Ford and Pat were intently scanning the
horizon.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat turned toward Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll reach the island about dawn,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford was looking at a chart
with a hand torch. One finger stopped at a tiny
island off the coast of Yucatan.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s our destination,” he said. “If Crazy
John knew what he was talking about, the
Southern Queen went down on a reef just off
the Isle of the Singing Trees.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What island?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The Isle of the Singing Trees. It’s marked
here on the chart and is uninhabited.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The <i>S-18</i> crept through the thinning night
at half speed and with the coming of the dawn,
they saw the outline of the island. It was small
and seemed barely able to keep its head above
the restless Caribbean. Breakers, indicating the
danger of hidden reefs, fringed the isle.
Through the powerful glasses they could see a
dense tangle of vegetation and beyond the Isle
of the Singing Trees the dim outlines of the
mainland, which was still shrouded by the
morning mists.</p>

<p class='c007' >The pulses of the men aboard the <i>S-18</i>
quickened. They were within sight of their
goal.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim scanned the surface of the ocean.
There was no sign of the <i>Iron Mate</i>, not even
a faint smudge of smoke to cause them
apprehension.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford ordered the Diesels
stopped. A piping hot breakfast was served to
every member of the crew and then the slow,
creeping trip toward the island was resumed.</p>

<p class='c007' >As they neared the desolate spot, Tim could
understand why Crazy John had not cared to
return. There was nothing beautiful about the
Isle of the Singing Trees. The beach was rough
and strewn with rock and as they approached
the island they heard the singing of the wind
through the tangled growth. Truly the island
had been well named.</p>

<p class='c007' >The island had never been adequately
charted, and Commander Ford was feeling his
way past the dangerous reefs, one of which had
brought a sudden end to the Southern Queen
eleven years before.</p>

<p class='c007' >Jagged splinters of rock reached up from the
ocean bottom to impale the hull of the <i>S-18</i>,
but each time the skilful hands of her
commander directed the submarine past the danger
spot. There was a brisk wind, and waves broke
sharply over the hull, but at last the <i>S-18</i> was
past the outer rim of rock which encircled the
island and safely into the smoother water.
Everyone breathed easier as the order to let go
the anchor came from the conning tower and
the mud hook was dropped sharply away.</p>

<p class='c007' >Two sturdy boats, both collapsible, were
brought up from the diving compartment and
assembled on the deck. Charlie Gill and Russ
Graham, the chief divers, checked over their
equipment and Pat gave Tim a hand in
loosening the fastenings which held the seaplane to
the deck.</p>

<p class='c007' >Joe Gartner even found time to polish his
beloved four inch gun and Tim felt that Joe
was secretly praying for a chance to get into
action against the <i>Iron Mate</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >When the first boat was lowered into the
water, Commander Ford stepped into the stern
and Charlie Gill and Russ Graham manned the
oars. The commander was going to waste no
time in attempting to locate the wreck of the
treasure ship.</p>

<p class='c007' >The crew of the <i>S-18</i>, clustered on deck,
watched the progress of the small boat as it
bobbed about inside the reefs. Both Gill and
Commander Ford were busy making
soundings while the other diver handled the boat.
Back and forth they crept along the reef, their
lines dragging the bottom for some sign of the
Southern Queen.</p>

<p class='c007' >The hours slipped away and the other boat,
in charge of Pat, joined the first in the quest for
the location of the old vessel.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim remained on deck, squatting in the
shadow of the seaplane. Ike Green joined him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Why don’t they take the <i>S-18</i> down and
creep along the bottom until they find the
Southern Queen?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Commander Ford’s afraid of the currents
around the reef. He wants to know something
about the bottom before he takes the <i>S-18</i>
down.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The remainder of the afternoon was spent
with the two small boats dragging their
grappling hooks along the bottom. At sundown the
weary crews returned to the submarine. There
was no use to ask whether they had found any
trace of the Southern Queen. The tired,
disappointed faces were enough.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What about the bottom?” Tim asked Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s going to be a tough proposition even if
we find the old ship. Lots of rock down there
and queer currents. There must be all kinds of
holes in the outer reef.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford was silent, planning the
activities for the next day, and everyone
aboard the submarine, except the watch, was
in their blankets early.</p>

<p class='c007' >The next morning at dawn the men of the
<i>S-18</i> were on deck, preparing for another day
of grappling for the wreckage of the Southern
Queen.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I wonder if Crazy John could have been
mistaken?” Tim asked Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s possible, but I don’t believe
Commander Ford would have fitted out an
expensive expedition like this if he hadn’t been pretty
sure of his facts. We’ve got a lot of territory
inside the reefs to explore before we give up
hope.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Or before Sladek and the <i>Iron Mate</i>
arrive,” put in Tim, searching the sky for a
possible trace of the seaplane from the tramp
steamer.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was a bright, burning sun and
throughout the morning hours the boat crews
toiled, dragging hooks on the uneven bottom.
After a hasty lunch, they returned to the
gruelling task. Tim, confident that the seaplane
could be made ready for flight in a minimum
time, squatted on the deck and watched the
operations.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was late afternoon when a joyful shout
from Pat rang across the water.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ve snagged something!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford in the other boat hastened
toward the spot and more grapnels were
dropped.</p>

<p class='c007' >Fifteen minutes later the men waiting on
the deck of the submarine knew that the
Southern Queen had been found. Commander Ford
dropped a line with a buoy and the two boats
headed back for the <i>S-18</i>. Fatigue was
miraculously wiped from the faces of the boatmen as
they pulled alongside, and Commander Ford
gave them the information they all sought.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Diving operations will start in the
morning,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was a joyous whoop from the crew
of the <i>S-18</i>. This was what they had been
watching for, a chance to get the treasure of the
Southern Queen.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c005'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE<br /> <br />The Battle with the <i>Iron Mate</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >Plans for the recovery of the treasure
of the Southern Queen were talked over
fully at mess that night.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The wreck is in about 185 feet of water,”
said Charlie Gill. “That’s not a bad depth in
itself but the currents down there are tough.
They might sweep a diver into a hole in the hull
and he’d never get out.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then you think we’d better take the <i>S-18</i>
right down beside the old ship so you can work
out of our own hull?” asked Commander Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >“From the standpoint of the diver, that’s
going to be the safest way,” said Charlie, “and
it will be a whole lot faster. Once we get our
hands on the gold we’ll be able to transfer it
directly aboard the <i>S-18</i>”</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re right. The currents you speak of
can cause trouble even for a submarine the size
of the <i>S-18</i>, but I guess that’s the only solution.
We’ll make our first dive in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Turning to Tim, he added: “You’d better
get your seaplane off the deck tonight. Make
it fast to the beach. I don’t want to lose any
time when daylight comes.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Members of the crew aided Tim in getting
the Sea King off the deck and into the water.
It was night before the task was completed, and
he taxied the trim little craft up to the beach
under the guiding rays of a searchlight on the
conning tower. While Tim was making the
plane fast for the night, Pat rowed in from the
<i>S-18</i> to take him back.</p>

<p class='c007' >The Isle of the Singing Trees was living up
to its name that night. The tangled mat of
underbrush came down close to the water’s
edge and from it came a mournful melody.
Now and then a vagrant breeze, skipping
through the tree tops, added a higher note and
Tim shivered at the loneliness and the
desolation. The lights of the <i>S-18</i>, a bare 200 yards
from the shore, looked far away. He was glad
when Pat’s boat grated on the rocky beach.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat also felt the weird atmosphere of the
island.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It isn’t healthy here,” he said. “Let’s get
back to the <i>S-18</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim jumped into the boat and they pulled
lustily toward the safety and comfort of the
submarine.</p>

<p class='c007' >Men slept restlessly on the <i>S-18</i> that night.
Tomorrow they were going to the bottom of
the bay. If fortune favored them, they would
come back to the surface with a wealth of
gold.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim was as restless as any of them, turning
and tumbling around in his narrow bunk. An
hour before dawn he slipped out of his
blankets, dressed, and went up on deck.
Commander Ford was in the conning tower and Tim
wondered whether he had slept any during the
night.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m a little anxious about the Sea King,”
said the flying reporter. “I’d like to turn the
searchlight on the beach.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not right now,” said the commander
softly. “There are lights of some kind over to
our left.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim turned sharply. Low in the water, and
far out, he caught the faint glow of lights.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The <i>Iron Mate</i>?” he asked breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Perhaps. We’ll have to wait until dawn to
know the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It may be some passing steamer.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“These are dangerous waters. Regular
traffic keeps away from this section of the coast.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim watched the lights intently. They were
barely moving, but it seemed as though they
were coming nearer.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was a faint glow in the east when
Commander Ford spoke again.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Go below and rout out the crew. Tell Joe
Gartner I want arms issued to every man. As
soon as that is done I want him up here for final
instructions.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim shot down the ladder into the control
room, landing with a bang that resounded
through the interior. He raced back to the
crew’s quarters. Men, only half awake,
tumbled from their bunks.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Everyone out!” cried Tim. “Joe, you’re to
issue arms at once. Then Commander Ford
wants to see you on deck.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Glory be,” croaked Joe. “It must be the
<i>Iron Mate</i>. Maybe I’ll get a chance to unlimber
my gun after all.”</p>

<p class='c007' >They tumbled into their clothes and went
forward where Joe issued ammunition belts and
revolvers. A stack of rifles was placed in a
special rack in the control room with a box of
ammunition beside them. The <i>S-18</i> was getting
ready for trouble.</p>

<p class='c007' >On deck Joe Gartner tore the tarpaulin off
the four inch gun. From the depths of the <i>S-18</i>
a half dozen shells were brought on deck and
the gun was trained on the cluster of lights.</p>

<p class='c007' >The sky lightened and a few minutes later
the tense group on the deck of the <i>S-18</i> made
out the outlines of the ship which was beyond
the reefs. It was the <i>Iron Mate</i>, rolling gently in
the swell.</p>

<p class='c007' >Through field glasses they could see men
clustered along the rail of the tramp steamer
and Tim thought he could see Sladek on the
bridge. The first move was up to the <i>Iron Mate</i>
and it was not long in coming. From the far
side of the steamer came the roar of an airplane
engine and the seaplane took wing, its colors
flashing in the bright rays of the sun.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Better get ashore at once and have your
own plane ready to take off,” Commander
Ford advised Tim. “Take Pat with you and be
sure that you have a light machine gun.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat got the gun and plenty of ammunition
from Joe Gartner and they tumbled into one
of the small boats and started for shore.</p>

<p class='c007' >Out to sea the other plane was climbing
rapidly, circling over the <i>Iron Mate</i>. It was up
2,000 feet by the time Tim and Pat reached the
Sea King and had torn off the motor coverings
and loosened the moorings.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim piled into the after cockpit and snapped
on the starter. The motor awoke with a roar
and he warmed it up thoroughly, keeping an
eye on the plane above. There was little wind
and he could take off in a straight dash across
the water.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat, the light machine gun in his arms,
climbed into the forward cockpit. There were
parachutes for both pilot and passenger and
Tim instructed his companion in the operation
of the chute.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If we go aloft I’ll get even with you for
some of the unhappy hours I’ve spent in that
tin fish,” chuckled Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat, a little white around the lips at the
thought of his first trip aloft, grinned gamely.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I can take it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007' >The plane from the <i>Iron Mate</i> was darting
toward the Isle of the Singing Trees. The ship
was coming down now in a terrific power
dive. Tim estimated the speed at nearly 150
miles an hour. The air was filled with the roar
of the motor.</p>

<p class='c007' >Then the oncoming plane levelled off and
flashed over the <i>S-18</i>. Something black hurtled
over the side.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim tried to shout, but his throat closed and
he could only gasp. Automatically he leaped
into action, his hand jamming the throttle on
full. The Sea King scuttled across the water,
angling away from the <i>S-18</i> while down from
the sky plummeted the black object. It struck
the water a good hundred yards away from the
<i>S-18</i> and a fountain of water arose in the air.
The noise of the bomb could be heard even
above the roar of the Sea King's powerful
motor.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim lifted the finely trimmed craft into the
air and set out in pursuit of the bomber. Below
them on deck of the <i>S-18</i> Gunner Joe was
training his sights on the <i>Iron Mate</i>. Tim,
looking down, saw a puff of smoke and a
fountain of water leap into the air beyond the
<i>Iron Mate</i>. Joe had overshot his target.</p>

<p class='c007' >But there was no time to watch the Iron
Mate now. Tim concentrated on the task of
bringing down the other plane. Ahead of him,
Pat crouched in the cockpit, the machine gun
ready.</p>

<p class='c007' >The seaplane was making a desperate
attempt to get under the shelter of the <i>Iron Mate</i>
but Tim drove on relentlessly on the tail of the
other ship. There was no chance for the pilot
to land and taxi back to the steamer.</p>

<p class='c007' >The Sea King was fast and easy to handle.
In less than two minutes Tim had overhauled
the bombing plane and Pat, sighting with a
steady hand, pulled gently on the trigger of the
light machine gun. It chattered and jumped,
but he got his aim again and poured a stream
of bullets at the target ahead.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim, watching intently and matching every
move of the fleeing pilot, saw the bullets
ripping into the wings. Then Pat got the range on
the fuselage and the line of bullets crept nearer
and nearer the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c007' >Sensing that death was near, the pilot tried
to loop and get onto the tail of Tim’s plane, but
the flying reporter guessed the maneuver
almost before it started and he placed Pat in a
position to pour a stream of bullets into the
motor of the other plane.</p>

<p class='c007' >Suddenly there was only the sound of their
own motor. The other seaplane was falling
away with its prop turning idly. Pat,
thoroughly angered at the attempt to sink the <i>S-18</i>
with a bomb, trained his gun on the other pilot
but Tim pulled the nose of the Sea King up
and spoiled his aim.</p>

<p class='c007' >"He’s all through,” he shouted. "They’ll
never be able to repair that motor.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Spread out below them was a strange
panorama. Against the green background of the Isle
of the Singing Trees the <i>S-18</i> was throwing
shell after shell at the <i>Iron Mate</i>, and the tramp
steamer was responding. One good, solid shot
would sink the <i>S-18</i>, while the <i>Iron Mate</i>
could stand a lot of shelling without going
down.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim noticed that the <i>S-18</i> was moving
slowly back and forth behind the reef and that
the submarine was ready to submerge at a
moment’s notice. Only Gunner Joe and the men
he had selected to help him load the gun were
on deck.</p>

<p class='c007' >"Joe’s using a lot of ammunition,” cried Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’d better get a direct aim soon or they’ll get
us after all.”</p>

<p class='c007' >A white line of bubbles streaked the water.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Joe’s fired his torpedo!” cried Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >A lookout on the <i>Iron Mate</i> saw the torpedo
and the old tramp swung its stern into the clear
just in time. The torpedo streaked on out to
sea.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim’s attention shifted back to the pilot
of the crippled seaplane. It was landing at least
a mile away from the <i>Iron Mate</i> and he admired
the cool nerve of the other pilot, who brought
his craft down to a safe landing. With motor
dead, the flyer would have to wait for a boat
from the <i>Iron Mate</i> to pick him up.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim sent the Sea King into a dive while Pat
shouted questions at him, landed and taxied
alongside the disabled plane.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat covered the other flyer with his machine
gun. Tim recognized the pilot as the man who
had flown the amphibian for Sladek on the trip
to Cedar river valley.</p>

<p class='c007' >Fierce anger glowed in the eyes of the other
pilot, but he remained silent as Tim scrambled
onto the right pontoon and made his way
toward the rear cockpit.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Don’t try any funny business,” Tim
warned. “My partner’s got an itchy trigger
finger.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ll never get away with this,” snarled
the other.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Don’t let that trouble you,” retorted Tim.
“You’d better worry how you’re going to get
away from here. You know if we decided to
put a few holes in your pontoons it would be a
long swim to the <i>Iron Mate</i> and the sharks
might be hungry.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You wouldn’t dare do that.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You tried to sink the <i>S-18</i>,” snapped Tim.
“Now get out of that cockpit and crawl down
on the other pontoon.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Shut up and get down on the pontoon like
he told you,” roared Pat, waving his gun
menacingly.</p>

<p class='c007' >The pilot of the disabled plane obeyed the
command and Tim scrambled into the
cockpit. In the bottom was what he had hoped for,
half a dozen small, high-explosive bombs.</p>

<p class='c007' >In less than five minutes he transferred the
deadly cargo to his own plane.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thanks a lot for the pineapples,” he yelled
at the disgruntled flyer clinging to the pontoon.
“I guess we won’t sink your plane after all.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Give me those surprise parties,” said Pat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You can’t gauge air speed,” replied Tim.
“I can fly and handle the bombing at the
same time. We’ll go low and you may be able
to rake the deck of the <i>Iron Mate</i> with your
gun.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat grinned and gave voice to a wild, Irish
battle cry as the Sea King leaped into the air.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was a gun both fore and aft on the
<i>Iron Mate</i>, and both of them were firing
steadily at the <i>S-18</i> when the Sea King flashed
over the first time.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat, leaning over the edge of the cockpit, let
a blistering blast of fire loose and Tim dropped
one of the bombs. It struck a scant 25 yards
beyond the <i>Iron Mate</i>, sending a great spray of
water into the air.</p>

<p class='c007' >Banking the Sea King sharply, they swept
back toward the tramp steamer. Men were
running excitedly about the deck for the attack
from the air had taken them by surprise.
Again Pat raked the deck with fire while Tim,
working rapidly, dropped two bombs
overboard.</p>

<p class='c007' >The first one missed, falling short, but the
second struck only a few feet from the gun on
the fore deck. There was a shattering blast of
flame and smoke, the scream of rent steel, and
the cries of frightened men.</p>

<p class='c007' >Relentlessly the Sea King bore down again.
This time Tim aimed at the after deck. There
were only three bombs left. He swooped low,
dropping only one of the missiles, but he had
the range and scored a direct hit. In less than a
minute both guns had been put out of
commission and the ship badly damaged.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll plant another ‘egg’ midships and then
call it a day,” yelled Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >Once more the Sea King, struts and wires
screaming vengeance, swept down. Again Tim
scored a hit, the blast from the third bomb
leveling the stubby masts and the funnel. The
deck of the ship was strewn with wreckage and
the <i>Iron Mate</i> was definitely out of commission
as far as any more fighting was concerned.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim landed the Sea King inside the barrier
of reefs and taxied alongside the <i>S-18</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Splendid work,” shouted Commander
Ford, and the others in the crew were loud in
their praise.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim and Pat made the Sea King fast again at
its moorings and rowed back to the submarine.
In the distance the <i>Iron Mate</i> was painfully
limping away from the scene.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c005'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO<br /> <br />Trapped</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >With the menace of the <i>Iron Mate</i>
definitely removed from their
thoughts, the crew of the <i>S-18</i> turned their full
attention to the task of retrieving the treasure
in the Southern Queen.</p>

<p class='c007' >Mess that noon was a hasty meal with
Commander Ford and the chief divers, Charlie Gill
and Russ Graham, taking just time enough to
grab a sandwich and gulp a cup of hot coffee.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was a haze over the mainland and the
air was heavy, surcharged with tension. The
song of the Isle of the Singing Trees was high
pitched and Tim would be glad to see the last
of the dismal island.</p>

<p class='c007' >Plans for the dive down to the hull of the
Southern Queen were completed. Members of
the crew hurried to their stations, hatches were
made fast and the warning bell echoed
throughout the interior.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim was in the diving compartment. Charlie
and Russ had already donned their diving suits
and entered the special compartment.
Telephone cables, protected by a steel sheeting, ran
into the main compartment, giving the divers
instant communication with their helpers.
Earl Bell was at the phones as chief assistant
with Roy Gould standing by.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford hurried up.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Everything all set?” he asked Bell.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Charlie and Russ are ready and
everything in the special diving compartment seems
to be all right.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Tell them we’re going down.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford hastened back to the
control room. From the rear of the <i>S-18</i> came the
hum of the powerful electrics. Tim felt the
submarine move slightly. They were going
down, going to the bottom of the treacherous
bay in search of a fortune in gold, a fortune
which had been under water for eleven
years.</p>

<p class='c007' >The special diving compartment in which
Charlie and Russ were seated filled with water.
Gently the <i>S-18</i> eased toward the bottom,
scarcely more than a foot at a time.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ten, twenty, thirty, forty feet they went
down. Tim watched the gauges fascinated.</p>

<p class='c007' >The two divers, in their heavily armored
suits, sat quietly in their compartment as the
pressure increased with the depth.</p>

<p class='c007' >The 100-foot mark was passed. Still the <i>S-18</i>
was going down. Roy Gould snapped on a
switch. Powerful searchlights set in the outer
hull especially for this operation cut the
blackness of the water. Strange fish blinked their
eyes and scuttled away from this monster
which was invading the deep.</p>

<p class='c007' >Now Tim was at one of the quartz windows.
In spite of their high power, the searchlights
were effective for only a few feet. While he
watched the gaunt mast of a ship came upward
from the depths. They were descending
almost on top of the Southern Queen.</p>

<p class='c007' >A stubby funnel, rising at a crazy angle, was
next, and ahead of that Tim thought he could
glimpse the battered bridge.</p>

<p class='c007' >The motion of the <i>S-18</i> was almost
imperceptible now. The divers, watching the
descent closely, were giving orders which Earl
Bell relayed on to the control room.</p>

<p class='c007' >The main deck of the Southern Queen, now
heavily encrusted with sea growth, came into
view and the <i>S-18</i> slid lower. There was a
gentle bump as it touched the bottom.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford came forward and took
the telephone from Earl. There was a slight jar
as the divers opened the outer door of their
compartment and stepped outside the hull of
the submarine. Pressure inside their own
compartment and that outside had been equalized
all of the way down and they were ready to
seek an opening into the interior of the treasure
ship.</p>

<p class='c007' >Moving slowly and with each carrying a
hand torch, they disappeared beyond the outer
rim of light.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was a tense group in the diving room,
clustered around Commander Ford. Tersely he
relayed the progress of the divers.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’re going back along the hull, hunting
for an opening. Charlie Gill says the current is
strong here but the footing is hard; probably
volcanic rock.”</p>

<p class='c007' >There was a moment of silence. Electric fans
kept a constant flow of air.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford spoke again. “They’re
still moving back. Wait! Russ Graham’s found
a hole, probably the one knocked in the hull
when the Southern Queen struck the reef.
They’re going inside!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Every word burned itself into Tim’s
memory. It took nerve even to go to the bottom of
the ocean, but then to get out of a submarine in
a diving suit and walk around the ocean floor
and climb into the interior of an old hull took
more than nerve.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’re not far from the ship’s strong
room,” went on Commander Ford, each word
low but distinct.</p>

<p class='c007' >Eagerly they waited for the next message
from the interior of the Southern Queen.
Would the divers be able to get into the strong
room? Would the treasure be there? A dozen
questions hammered through the mind of every
man aboard the <i>S-18</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >Roy Gould checked the even flow of air
through the air lines. It was the life blood for
the men outside. Once that stopped they
wouldn’t have a chance.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford bent nearer the
mouthpiece of the phone, pressed the headset closer
to his ears, straining for the first word of the
treasure. His hands were shaking slightly.</p>

<p class='c007' >Then he turned toward them, his voice
hoarse with excitement.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’re in the strong room; they’ve found
the treasure!”</p>

<p class='c007' >His words echoed the length of the <i>S-18</i>
and a shout went up from the crew.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Charlie Gill says someone must have made
an attempt to get the treasure out before the
Southern Queen sunk. The door of the strong
room is open and several of the steel chests are
outside the door. They’re bringing them out
now.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Minutes passed as the divers, each carrying
a steel chest, made their way out of the interior
of the Southern Queen and back along the side
of the <i>S-18</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim’s keen eyes were the first to see them.
Russ Graham was ahead, his arms wrapped
around a rusty steel chest. Close behind came
Charlie Gill, with a similar chest in his arms.
They deposited these in the diving
compartment and waved to the men watching them
through the quartz windows.</p>

<p class='c007' >Then they were beyond the circle of light,
seeking more treasure in the hold of the old
tramp steamer.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How long can they remain down at this
depth?” Tim asked the commander.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not long. The pressure is too great, but
Charlie and Russ are the best divers in the
world. They’ll stick as long as they dare.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Another and still another trip was made by
the divers into the hold of the Southern Queen.
The pile of steel boxes mounted. Six were
stacked together. There were only two more.
Then the job would be done.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ike Green came running forward from his
radio room.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Something mighty funny is happening near
us,” he told Commander Ford. “My
microphones are picking up all kinds of noises within
the last two minutes.”</p>

<p class='c007' >A slight tremor ran through the hull of the
<i>S-18</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford shouted into the
telephone.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Charlie! Russ! Return at once! Don’t
attempt to bring out the rest of the gold. Hurry!”</p>

<p class='c007' >There was another slight movement. Men
looked at each other in amazement and fear.
Out of the darkness came the divers. Charlie
Gill had a treasure chest. Russ Graham’s arms
were empty. Into the protection of their
diving compartment they stumbled. With a clang
the outer doors snapped shut.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’re getting back to the surface as soon as
possible and away from the hull of the Southern
Queen at once,” snapped Commander Ford.</p>

<p class='c007' >Men hastened back to their posts, but before
they could get there, the <i>S-18</i> moved again.
From the outside there was the sound of metal
scraping against metal. Then silence.</p>

<p class='c007' >They took their places, diving planes were
adjusted for the ascent and orders flew from
Commander Ford’s lips. The electric motors
purred smoothly. Compressed air hissed into
the ballast tanks, blowing the water out to
lighten the submarine. Tim, watching the
depth gauge, waited for the needle to move.</p>

<p class='c007' >Earl Bell came into the control room.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You might as well shut off the motors and
save the air,” he said dully. “That last shock
put a part of the hull of the Southern Queen
on top of us. We’re trapped.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c005'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE<br /> <br />Desperate Hours</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >The men in the control room stared at
Bell with unbelieving eyes.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I tell you part of the hull of the Southern
Queen has been rolled over on top of us,”
shouted Earl. “We’re trapped! We’re
trapped!” His voice broke.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim felt sick. Down 185 feet under the
surface of the water, there was no way of sending
up news of their predicament and no one there
even if they could send it up.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford remained calm.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Stay at your posts,” he ordered. “I’ll go
forward and see what can be learned.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim followed him. The Commander took
over the telephone and spoke to the divers,
sitting inside their compartment.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What can you make out?” he asked Charlie
Gill.</p>

<p class='c007' >The reply was not encouraging.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Part of the upperstructure of the Southern
Queen was toppled over on us when that last
earth shock came,” reported Gill. “I’m going
outside and see what can be done.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The doors of the diving compartment
clicked open and the chief diver disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007' >Long minutes dragged by. There was no
word from the man on whom they were
pinning so much of their hopes.</p>

<p class='c007' >Finally Charlie Gill staggered back into
view. Tim knew from the sag of his shoulders
that the mission had been useless.</p>

<p class='c007' >Again the doors of the diving compartment
were shut and he heard Gill’s voice coming
over the wire into the receivers on Commander
Ford’s head.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’re caught tight,” reported the diver.
“There doesn’t seem to be a chance to escape.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim looked down at the rusty treasure
chests, piled in such a haphazard fashion on the
floor of the outer diving compartment. All
thought of the treasure had left their minds
now. The one desire was to get back to the
surface.</p>

<p class='c007' >The <i>S-18</i> quivered occasionally as new
earth shocks rocked the bottom of the ocean.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford put down the headset and
turned back toward the control room.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll try it again,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007' >The electrics hummed, the propellers
threshing first one way and then another, but there
was no upward movement of the submarine.</p>

<p class='c007' >The water was blown from the diving
compartment and Gill and Graham struggled out
of their diving suits.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford called them to one side,
and they conversed at length. Tim caught only
snatches of the conversation, but it was enough
to tell him that their situation was almost
hopeless. Already the air inside the <i>S-18</i> seemed
heavy and his head ached miserably.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How long can we last?” he asked Pat, who
was standing by in the control room.</p>

<p class='c007' >The chief officer shrugged.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Let’s not think about that.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The motors were shut off and the only sound
was the faint humming of the ventilating fans as
they forced a current of air from one
compartment to another.</p>

<p class='c007' >The crew, gathered in little groups,
conversed in whispers. Joe Gartner, the gunner,
battered open the top of one of the treasure
chests and neat rows of gold bars were revealed.
There was only a murmur of enthusiasm.
Any man aboard would have traded a safe
trip back to the surface for his share of the
gold.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford decided upon a desperate
plane of action. A special bomb with a time
fuse was rigged and Charlie Gill donned his
diving suit again and went outside. They saw
him working his way along the hull of the
Southern Queen. Somewhere out there he
would plant the bomb in the hope that the
explosion would loosen the wreckage and allow
the <i>S-18</i> to shoot toward the surface.</p>

<p class='c007' >Fifteen minutes later he was back. In five
more minutes the bomb would go off. Tim
literally counted every second. The crew
waited at their posts and the motors were ready
to push the <i>S-18</i> toward the surface if they
broke free.</p>

<p class='c007' >The <i>S-18</i> shook slightly. The propellers
threshed madly, but there was no upward
movement.</p>

<p class='c007' >This time Russ Graham went outside. When
he came back he shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Explosive won’t budge the wreckage,” he
said. “It would take a bucket of nitro at this
depth and we haven’t any nitro.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Despair lined the face of every man who
heard those words. Most of them were
submarine men, and they knew what was
ahead—bad air, headaches, dimming lights, then
darkness for the <i>S-18</i> and for them.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We might as well save the electricity,”
said Commander Ford. Lights were turned off
until only one bulb gleamed in each
compartment.</p>

<p class='c007' >Some of the men got together a meal. Tim
didn’t feel like eating. Still true to the code of
reporters, he sat down and with pencil and
paper wrote the story of the last dive of the
<i>S-18</i>. For an hour he wrote. Time meant
nothing to the men now. The end would come
when the light faded and the air gave out.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim’s head pounded to the throbbing of the
blood through his body. A few of the men
rolled into their blankets, trying to sleep. The
treasure chests were forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007' >The hours passed and Tim wrote slowly,
recording his impressions.</p>

<p class='c007' >The storage batteries had been drained of
their reserve by the heavy pulls of the motors
in trying to free the submarine and now only
two lights were on, one in the control room,
the other in the crew’s quarters.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was hard to breath. The air was thick and
foul. A thin stream of water was spurting into
the engine room where a seam had opened
under the pressure and the weight of the
wreckage above it. Tim could hear the water
splashing on the floor.</p>

<p class='c007' >The light was dimmer, only a faint glow
now. Then it was gone. Writing was a thing of
the past, but in his hands he held the record of
their tragedy. Perhaps someday the <i>S-18</i> would
be found and their story known.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim fumbled for his blankets. The air was
cold. He laid down on the bunk. Up ahead
was the steady splashing of the water. Back of
him a man was quietly praying.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim closed his eyes. His head was splitting.
Perhaps sleep would bring peace.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was no sound in the <i>S-18</i> except the
low breathing of men who were saving every
precious breath and the sound of the water
coming in through the opened seam.</p>

<p class='c007' >“When the water reaches the batteries
there’ll be chlorine,” someone muttered.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Let’s hope it reaches them soon,”
another voice replied. “This waiting is what
hurts.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim was drowsy, his mind a blank. The end
was near for all of them. Another half hour,
not much longer.</p>

<p class='c007' >An occasional earth tremor could be felt,
but they were less distinct.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim was on the verge of unconsciousness
when the <i>S-18</i> rocked sharply as though a giant
hand had grasped the conning tower and was
shaking the big undersea craft in a playful
manner. There was the faint sound of scraping
metal, followed by another shock which threw
men from their bunks.</p>

<p class='c007' >Water was cascading in upon them. Screams
filled the air.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ve broken in two,” was one desperate
cry.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim struggled to get to his feet. Water
swished about his feet and someone knocked
him down. Pat was shouting wildly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Shut up!” he cried. “Try and get to your
stations. We’re moving!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Men paused, dazed by the words. Gradually
the meaning penetrated their fagged brains and
through the darkness they hunted for their
places.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pat was right. Without power of its own,
the <i>S-18</i> was moving. Slowly at first, then with
an upward rush that tumbled them about like
jack-straws. The slim nose burst through the
water and rose above the surface.</p>

<p class='c007' >Commander Ford, who had remained in the
control room, crawled up the ladder and
opened the main hatch. A breath of fresh, sweet
air, swept down into grateful faces. One by
one the men crawled out on the deck.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was the dawn of the second day. They had
been saved from death below the surface, saved
by an earthquake which had shifted the
wreckage of the Southern Queen off the hull of the
<i>S-18</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim looked toward the Isle of the Singing
Trees. The seaplane was riding safely just off
the beach. It was less than 48 hours since they
had gone below but he had lived a lifetime
in those desperate hours of darkness and
despair.</p>

<p class='c007' >For half an hour they relaxed, basking in the
sunshine of the early morning. Then they set
about making the <i>S-18</i> ready for the long cruise
back to New York.</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim, remembering the story he had written
while they were on the bottom, plunged below.
Part of the paper was wet, but Ike Green
decided he could read it and he sat down at the
radio to transmit it to the New York Journal
and the Atkinson <i>News</i>.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m sending a story on the recovery of the
treasure,” Tim said to Commander Ford.
“How much shall I say the gold totals?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It will exceed two million dollars,” smiled
the Commander, “which means a tidy sum for
every member of the crew.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I wouldn’t go through that experience
again for a whole million,” replied Tim.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Neither would I,” agreed the Commander.
“It was little short of a miracle that saved us
from death.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Out of the air crackled a message that
afternoon. It was from George Carson, back in
Atkinson.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Your story is the best of the year,” radioed
the managing editor of the <i>News</i>. “Congratulations
on a fine piece of writing, but don’t take
any more chances by going down in a
submarine.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Tim slipped the message in a pocket. It had
been a great adventure, more thrilling by far
than he had ever dared to dream, but he would
be glad when the <i>S-18</i> nosed its way back into
New York harbor.</p>
